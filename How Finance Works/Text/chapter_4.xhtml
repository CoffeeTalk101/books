<p class="noindent"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_115" aria-label="115"></span>In <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>, we discussed how creating value for shareholders is an important goal for managers. But what does it mean to “create” value? And how do you do it? Let’s take a look at two extreme examples to better understand how value can be created or destroyed. For value creation, let’s take a look at Apple’s stock price performance for the last thirty years. (See <a href="#fig4-1">figure 4-1</a>.)</p>
<p>As you can see from the chart, Apple wasn’t creating much value for its shareholders for the majority of its life as a public company. The company existed, but it might as well not have bothered; while expending a great deal of effort to compete with IBM and Microsoft, it was essentially treading water in terms of value creation.</p>
<p>Beginning in the early 2000s, things changed dramatically. Apple started creating value, and a great deal of it. Apple stock was worth more than $1 trillion by mid-2018. What changed? What did Apple do differently that changed its fortunes? The short answer is it created a new generation of products ranging from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. But the better question is, why did the inception of the iPhone cause Apple to create value when years of creating Macintosh computers did not?</p>
<p>What about the opposite—value destruction? For that, let’s take a look at the stock price chart of Avon Products, a cosmetics company, from January 2009 through October 2018. (See <a href="#fig4-2">figure 4-2</a>).</p>

<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_116" aria-label="116"></span>During the nine-year period, Avon lost 90 percent of its value. Why? Clearly, there were failures to innovate and to create a sustainable business model. But how can a company lose so much value so quickly?</p>
<p>These two examples of extreme value creation and destruction provide two lessons. First, value creation is neither simple nor straightforward. Second—and this is the brutal truth—finance is hard, and sometimes the best equity analysts and investors get it wrong. Avon was significantly overvalued for many years and, as investors realized their mistake, the price fell to reflect its more accurate value.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to take a closer look at how companies can create and maximize value. In particular, the recipe for value creation hinges on the idea of costly capital. As stewards of the capital entrusted to them by equity and debt holders, managers must consider the cost of that capital, even if that cost is not explicit. In effect, the returns demanded by capital providers become the costs of capital for managers. Finally, we need to settle on a way to define and measure risk because the returns demanded by capital providers will be a function of the risk these providers of capital bear.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, we’ll be ready to combine the ideas about free cash flow from <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a> with the ideas of costs of capital, expected returns, and risk from this chapter to undertake the process of valuation. In some ways, this chapter is the toughest one in this book, but if you emerge from it with the core intuitions provided in the figures, then you’re winning.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_117" aria-label="117"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">How Is Value Created?</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Our first measure of value creation compares a company’s book value and its market value via the market-to-book ratio. Book value is simply an accounting of the capital that shareholders have invested in a company, whereas market value measures how much a company is worth according to the financial markets—and, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, market values are a forward-looking assessment of the value of a company.</p>
<p>Since book values are derived from accounting-based balance sheets and solely focus on the dollars invested in a company, they provide an incomplete picture of value. For example, take a look at <a href="#tab4-1">table 4-1</a> for Facebook’s balance sheet at the end of 2017 based on book values and market values.</p>
<p>While the market value of Facebook’s equity is $512.8 billion, its book value is much lower, $74.3 billion. This yields a market-to-book ratio of 6.9. Given that market values emphasize future cash flows (see <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>), the market thinks highly of Facebook’s prospects and its ability to create value.</p>
<p>We’re going to do a few exercises to puzzle through the sources of value creation, as we did with financial analysis in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>. Like that exercise, these may be tough but have a considerable payoff.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a company that relies solely on equity financing:</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BL">The firm has a book value of $100, as it has just been capitalized with $100.</li>
<li class="BL">The return on equity is projected to be 20 percent.</li>
<li class="BL">The company is expected to reinvest 50 percent of its profits in the company. These reinvestments represent growth opportunities and earn similar returns to its current return on equity (ROE).</li>
<li class="BL">The company will end its operations after ten years, and anything that’s left will be distributed to the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_118" aria-label="118"></span>shareholders. It will sell all of its assets for a onetime cash flow (assume it can do so at the book value of those assets at that time).</li>
<li class="BLL">Future cash flows will be discounted at a rate of 15 percent because shareholders expect a return of 15 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what should this company’s market-to-book ratio be? That is, is the company creating value? To make things simpler and more concrete, is your intuition that the market-to-book ratio is greater than 1, equal to 1, or less than 1?</p>
<p>To determine its market-to-book ratio, we need to figure out its book value and its market value. The book value is $100 as given above. Its market value, however, requires forecasting and discounting future cash flows, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>. While there’s a simpler way to figure this out, let’s try a more roundabout way first.</p>
<p>Take that initial book value of $100, apply the 20 percent ROE, and then distribute half to shareholders and reinvest the other half in the company. Then apply the 15 percent discount rate to those dividends. Do this for the first year until the tenth year, when whatever is left in the company is liquidated and returned to the shareholders. (See <a href="#tab4-2">table 4-2</a>.)</p>
<p>In this particular case, today’s market value, based on those expectations of what’s going to happen in the future, is greater than 100, which leads to a market-to-book ratio greater than 1.3.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to conclude this without creating a full spreadsheet? To think this through, let’s say the company’s ROE drops from 20 percent to 15 percent and everything else stays the same. What would happen to the market-to-book ratio? Your instinct is likely that the ratio will go down given that a lower ROE is not as good for shareholders. But how far will it drop?</p>
<p>If you create a spreadsheet as in the previous example, you’ll see that the market value will drop to 100, which is the same as its book value. To be clear, it drops to <i>exactly</i> 100; that is no coincidence. You might think that earning an ROE of 15 percent is quite good. But, in fact, the company has merely met expectations. This is the harsh logic of finance. If the ROE is the same as the cost of capital, nothing else matters—the company is not creating value. You could have stayed in bed.</p>
<p>This comparison teaches us that the <i>sine qua non</i> of value creation is beating the cost of capital. In the first example, equity is earning 20 percent, and shareholders are only discounting future cash flows by 15 percent. That simple comparison—expected returns on an investment versus the cost of capital—is all you need to know to think through whether or not a company is creating value.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Avon and Apple are pretty clear examples of value destruction and value creation, respectively. But what if the distinction is not so clear? How can we understand the data to be sure a firm is creating or destroying value?</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Let’s look at a less clear-cut case. The graphs show the stock price and return on capital for British Petroleum (BP) since 2000.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Is BP creating value? The stock price has increased from $20 to $46, so that’s good, right? It must be creating value. Taking a closer look, that price increase took place entirely from 2003 to 2008, and the stock price has stagnated since then. So let’s examine those periods separately.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Did BP create value from 2003 to 2008? There the answer is clear; it shows up where we’d expect it to be in its operations—in its return on capital. BP had a return on capital well over 10 percent and was significantly outperforming its cost of capital, thereby creating value—and this showed up in a rising stock price.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">After 2008, BP’s return on capital declined significantly to levels well below its cost of capital. That value destruction is apparent in the stagnant stock price. You might think that this has been neither bad nor good for BP shareholders (and maybe even good, if you consider that BP gave a 4 percent dividend), but that’s not the right way to think about it. BP shareholders had expected higher returns when they bought those shares, given competing opportunities. BP didn’t deliver those expected returns, so its shareholders suffered during this period by earning a return much lower than their expected returns. By failing to beat its cost of capital and thus failing to produce the expected return of its shareholders, BP provides an example of value destruction.</span></p>

<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_120" aria-label="120"></span>If the ROE were to drop even more, from 15 percent to 10 percent, the market value would dip below 100, making the market-to-book ratio less than 1. This is an even worse scenario. It means that the company is not providing returns commensurate with the capital providers’ expectations and, as a consequence, is destroying value. You may feel that a 10 percent ROE is pretty good, but the company is returning less to capital providers than they demand given the risk they assumed. It’s not just that you <i>could</i> have stayed in bed, but you <i>should</i> have stayed in bed.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">What Else Matters in Value Creation?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The relationship between returns on investments and costs of capital isn’t the only factor that will have an impact on the amount of value creation. Let’s consider other factors. We’ll vary the ROE (as we did before), the duration of the project, and the amount of profits reinvested in the business, but not the discount rate, which will stay fixed at 15 percent. How do you think ROEs, durations, and reinvestment rates will change market-to-book ratios, with other factors constant?</p>

<p>You might quickly surmise that higher ROEs will increase market-to-book ratios. But what happens as the hypothetical company lives for 30 years instead of 10 years? What happens as more and more earnings are reinvested? And is the effect of duration and reinvestment on market-to-book ratios a function of the ROE?</p>
<p><a href="#tab4-3">Table 4-3</a> is a blank table with different variations of ROEs, horizons, and reinvestment rates. Before you peek ahead, let’s focus on the first panel—with a 30 percent reinvestment rate—and answer two questions: Where will the highest and lowest market-to-book ratios be? Are there any situations when the ratio is exactly 1?</p>
<p><a href="#tab4-4">Table 4-4</a> provides the answers for the first panel. The highest market-to-book ratio is at the bottom right. The company would be earning its highest ROE, which would lead to higher market values, and it would be doing it for the longest period of time. High ROEs over a long time span: that’s what makes market-to-book ratios and value creation significant.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to guess that the smallest market-to-book ratio will be in upper left corner as that is the opposite circumstance. In fact, the smallest market-to-book ratio is in the lower left. In this scenario, the company’s ROE doesn’t beat its cost of capital (its discount rate), but despite this, the company persists for thirty years, resulting in a great deal of value destruction. Finally, look at the column in which the ROEs are 15 percent. No matter the time horizon, the market-to-book ratio will always be 1. A company could go on for five years or thirty years or a hundred years. It doesn’t matter. Since its ROE is the same as its cost of capital, it’s not going to create value, no matter how long it operates. Now let’s return to the blank table in <a href="#tab4-3">table 4-3</a> and consider the effects of varying reinvestment rates from 30 percent to 70 percent to 100 percent. Let’s ask the same questions but for the whole table: Where will the highest and lowest market-to-book <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_122" aria-label="122"></span>ratios be? Are there any more situations when the ratio is exactly 1?</p>

<p>As <a href="#tab4-5">table 4-5</a> reveals, the highest market-to-book ratio is in the bottom right corner of the entire table, and it’s very large. The company is beating its cost of capital by a wide margin for thirty years, and it is reinvesting all those profits at this higher rate for the whole thirty years.</p>
<p>The worst scenario is at the bottom left. The company is destroying value because it’s not meeting the cost of capital. It’s doing so for a long period of time, thirty years, and it never distributes any money until the very end. So even more value is being destroyed when the company invests more profits at that relatively low rate of return.</p>
<p>Where are the rest of the 1.0s? Sure enough, the 15 percent ROE scenarios always give a 1.0 market-to-book ratio because the company is just meeting its cost of capital. It can keep cash inside or release it, and it can do so for many years or just a few; it just doesn’t matter because value is being neither created or destroyed.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Three Ways to Create Value</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This exercise provides finance’s basic recipe for value creation. To create value, companies must do three things. First and foremost, they must beat their cost of capital. If they don’t, nothing else matters. Second, they must beat their cost of capital for many years. And, third, they must reinvest additional <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_123" aria-label="123"></span>profits at high rates through growth. These prescriptions also correspond to business strategy. Beating a cost of capital is all about creating a competitive advantage through innovation. Keeping the gap open between returns and costs of capital for longer periods is what barriers to entry, brands, and intellectual property protection are all about. Finally, reinvesting more profits is all about growing an opportunity through expansions, adjacencies, or integration.</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">While it’s one thing to see this play out in a spreadsheet, these measures of value creation are exactly what equity analysts like Alberto Moel, formerly of Bernstein, look at in the real world. Moel commented:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">So if a company is generating excess returns on its capital, over a long period of time, you will see that in the shareholder return. Of course, over the short term, it is all over the place, but in the long term, that’s the key. So if you find a company that has excess returns, meaning that it’s generating more than its cost of capital consistently, or at least over many years, then you know that company will generate excess returns to the shareholder, so that’s how we approach it.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="a-head_2line"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">A Deeper Dive into Costs of Capital</span></p>
<p class="noindent">This exercise shows that the cost of capital is critical to value creation. Managers apply discount rates to penalize future cash flows, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, because there is an opportunity cost to any investment. Those discount rates are often referred to as costs of capital because they refer to the penalties (costs) associated with deploying that capital. Where do those discount rates and costs of capital come from?</p>
<p>Recall that firms have two types of capital providers—lenders who provide debt capital and owners who provide equity capital. The key insight is that the costs of capital are a function of the returns that investors expect. In short, an investor’s expected return becomes the cost of capital for managers. The costs of debt and equity will be different; equity is a residual claim with a variable return, whereas debt has a fixed return that has priority for repayment.</p>
<p>So where do these expected returns (that become costs of capital) come from? Providers of capital will measure the risk that they are exposed to and expect returns to compensate for that risk. The demand for additional returns to bear risk is a foundational idea in finance and relates to risk aversion. Would you prefer a sure $1 million or a 50/50 chance at <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_124" aria-label="124"></span>$0 or $2 million? While it’s tempting to think otherwise, if this were a real situation, most of us would choose $1 million, which shows a preference for a certain amount relative to a probability-weighted amount.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1" id="box-pg124"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">An Introduction to Risk and Return</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Investors demand higher returns from companies that they consider to have greater risk, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>. Those demands for higher returns translate into higher costs of capital.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Investors, like most of us, are risk averse. It’s human nature. As a consequence, if they are forced to bear risk, they will demand something in return. Think about labor markets. When people take jobs in riskier industries such as construction, they demand higher wages. That same thing is true in finance.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Consider four types of assets in which people can invest: obligations of the US government that mature in thirty days, obligations of the US government that mature in thirty years, common stocks for small companies, and common stocks for large companies.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The table gives the annual average returns for those four asset classes, from 1926 to 2010, compiled from the Ibbotson</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">SBBI Yearbook</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">. Alongside the returns, a standard deviation of returns is listed. A standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of returns around that average return. A zero standard deviation would indicate that each year had exactly the average return. Higher standard deviations correspond to more variable returns.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One helpful rule of thumb is that two-thirds of observations will fall within one standard deviation of the average. For example, the average adult height in your town might be five feet six inches, and the standard deviation might be four inches. In this example, two-thirds of the adults would be between five feet two inches and five feet ten inches.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The table indicates that on average, investors will earn 9.9 percent on large company common stocks, and in two of three years, their return will fall between −10.5 percent and 30.3 percent (that’s 9.9 ± 20.4 percent). Contrast that with government bonds, where investors will earn an average return of 5.5 percent, and in two or three years, the return will be between −4.0 percent and 15 percent.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">As this table demonstrates, returns are related to the risk a given investor bears. In particular, equities give a higher return, but they also make you bear more risk because returns can fluctuate greatly; returns may be very high one year, and very low or negative in another year.</span></p>

<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">In order to measure the reward for bearing risk, investors often divide the returns of an asset class by the associated standard deviation. In other words, this ratio enables investors to determine how much return they receive per unit of risk. This measure is called the Sharpe ratio, one of the key ways investors measure risk.

<p>But how do we actually operationalize the idea of cost of capital? How do we measure the appropriate amount to charge for risk? These questions lead us to some of the most elegant ideas in all of finance.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_125" aria-label="125"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Weighted Average Cost of Capital</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, is the most common way to discount future cash flows but is also one of those mysterious phrases that people in finance like to throw around to intimidate others. But it’s really quite transparent if we break it down and use pictures to think it through. The phrase implies multiple sources of capital, and we know there are two types of capital that must be associated with two different costs: the cost of debt and the cost of equity. We can’t simply add them but should average them to account for their relative proportions.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_126" aria-label="126"></span>The formula for a WACC features the two costs of capital, two weights to account for their relative proportion, and a tax term.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Weighted Average Cost of Capital</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg126.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The costs of debt and equity are their expected returns. For now, simply think about the weights as a share of the total financing needs that come from debt and equity.</p>
<p>The tax term requires a little more explanation. Interest payments are typically deductible expenses that can lower a firm’s tax payments. In effect, these interest payments shield a company from paying more taxes and are known as “tax shields.” How much benefit the interest payments provide because of their deductibility depends on the tax rate. If tax rates are high, the ability to deduct interest payments is very valuable. If the tax rate is 40 percent, and a company has to pay $10 in interest payments, how much does it actually cost to pay $10? The company is out $10, but its pretax income is lower by $10, and that lowers their tax bill by $4, so the true cost is $6.</p>
<p>The actual calculation of a WACC is straightforward. If 20 percent of a company’s financing is debt that costs 10 percent, 80 percent of its financing is equity that costs 20 percent, and the tax rate is 10 percent, calculating the WACC of 17.8 percent is fairly simple.</p>
<p>The deeper questions are: Where do the weights come from? Where do those costs of debt and equity come from? If equity is a residual claim, how can you capture the cost of equity? Which is more expensive—debt or equity? We’re going to construct a WACC because it builds important finance intuitions, and the idea of WACC is best demystified by having to actually do it.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The cost of debt</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Determining the cost of debt is the most straightforward element of this calculation. Because debt has a fixed return, the cost of capital is simply the interest rate that a lender will charge you when you are undertaking a project.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_127" aria-label="127"></span>To arrive at an interest rate, a bank will examine the riskiness of the underlying business, the stability of its cash flows, and its credit rating. Then, it’ll charge an interest rate commensurate with that risk. (Technically, that interest rate is the <i>promised</i> return and there is a probability that the issuer will default, meaning that the expected return is slightly lower.)</p>
<p>That interest rate has two components that correspond to the reasons we penalize cash flows for making us wait:</p>

<p class="BTNI1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">In explaining cost of capital, you have to come back to a single concept. In order to build your business, you use money. Who is lending or investing this money with you? You have shareholders and banks or bondholders; you need to give a fair remuneration to all those people. And depending on the structure of your capital, of your financing, then you have an average cost of capital, which is basically what it costs you to be in business; this is very sound. No one would invest their own money to get an unreasonable return. It is very sound to give those stakeholders a return that they are expecting.</span></p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The risk-free rate.</span> Investors will demand, at a minimum, the rate on a risk-free investment; this idea of a risk-free investment is approximated by the interest rate on government securities such as US Treasury bonds. At a minimum, the logic goes, any risky project should provide what we demand from a risk-free asset. Why do investors charge a cost of capital in the absence of risk? We as investors don’t just dislike risk; we also like things now rather than later, and we need compensation for delaying the enjoyment of our wealth. More specifically, we prefer money now rather than later because we are impatient and we want to be compensated for any expected inflation because that inflation will reduce our purchasing power.</h4>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Credit spreads.</span> A credit spread reflects the additional cost associated with the riskiness of the debt. As you might expect, riskier companies feature higher credit spreads. In mid-2018, US Treasurys with a maturity of ten years were yielding (i.e., providing a return of) 2.96 percent. At that time, Walmart, an AA-rated company (the typical rating system begins with AAA (close to risk-free) and descends to A, to BBB and then B, and then to CCC and C), issued $16 billion of debt to finance its acquisition of Flipkart in India and paid an interest rate of 3.55 percent, implying a credit <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_128" aria-label="128"></span>spread of 0.59 percent. At the same time, CVS, a BBB company, issued debt to finance its acquisition of Aetna with an interest rate of 4.33 percent, implying a credit spread of 1.37 percent. Cequel Communications, a cable company, issued CCC debt at 7.5 percent, implying a credit spread of 4.54 percent. That’s a pretty straightforward relationship between risk and return.</h4>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Costs of debt comprise the risk-free rate plus a risk premium for credit risk.

<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">First, notice that the yield curve normally slopes upward. Longer-term debt typically, but not always, needs to offer a higher interest rate than short-term bonds. Why? In part, the steepness of the yield curve reflects expectations of future interest rates. A steep curve reflects that future interest rates are expected to be higher and longer-term bonds must compensate investors for fixing their interest rates for a longer period. Future interest rates might be expected to be higher because of future growth or inflation expectations. Second, notice the difference between the treasury rates and the corporate AAA and CCC bonds, whose yield curves lie above the treasury curve. This is the result of the risk premium increasing the cost of the debt, as discussed earlier.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Bond yield curves change constantly in response to market expectations about the future.

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The likelihood of, and the costs associated with, financial distress are two factors that limit how much debt a firm should take on. Firms can lose between 10 percent and 23 percent of their value prior to bankruptcy as a result of unexpected cuts in capital expenditures, undesired asset sales, and costly managerial myopia. Bankruptcies induced by financial distress can be extremely costly; as one example, the fees associated with Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy exceeded $2 billion.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Let’s look at three companies: NextEra Energy Resources, a wholesale electricity supplier based in Florida; AbbVie, a mature pharmaceutical company; and TripAdvisor, a young travel website company. Which one do you think has the most leverage, which has the least, and which is in between?</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Energy companies like NextEra have stable, predictable cash flows and worry less about a sudden change causing financial distress. You might think that the pharmaceutical industry is risky—and it is—but more mature companies have patents and stable cash flows. Internet companies like TripAdvisor operate in an environment with less stable cash flows, so both the likelihood and costs of financial distress are much larger.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">AbbVie has a higher amount of debt, but it’s useful to remember what we went over regarding Merck and Pfizer in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>: companies in the pharmaceutical industry, in general, have been increasing the amount of debt they have on their books. This likely means that they consider the likelihood and costs of financial distress to be diminishing, an indication that perhaps this industry is taking fewer risks and producing more stable cash flows.</span></p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Optimal capital structure</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The relative use of debt and equity in a company is referred to as its capital structure. The right capital structure varies by industry and by the relative riskiness of those industries (as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a> with Carolina Power &amp; Light vs. Intel). Regulated monopolies like power companies often <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_130" aria-label="130"></span>have capital structures heavily weighted toward debt because of their steady cash flows; high-risk companies with unpredictable futures are weighted toward equity.</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig4-3"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 4-3</span></p>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="../Images/Figure_04-03.svg"><img src="../Images/Figure_04-03.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="925"/></object>
</figure>
<p>One way to envision the decision about capital structure is to consider the offsetting incentives to use debt based on taxation and the costs and probabilities of failure. The theory of optimal capital structure, as depicted in <a href="#fig4-3">figure 4-3</a>, tries to do that by first counterintuitively ignoring these effects and then layering them on.</p>
<p>This figure depicts the relationship between capital structure and overall firm value. As the relative use of debt increases, what happens to firm value? The first insight from the blue line is that, ignoring the effects of taxation and the costs of failure, all value comes from the real operations of a firm, so value should be invariant to capital structure. This assessment is an important starting point, as it’s a reminder that the deployment of assets—not financial engineering—is the source of all real value creation. But it also suggests that capital structure doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>As noted previously, because they are deductible, interest payments allow you to shield income from taxation. As you take on more debt relative to equity, you shield more income from the government, and value increases, as shown by the orange line. Indeed, it would make sense to use all debt and no equity because with every additional dollar of debt, you are saving more money with taxes.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider the effects of too much leverage on business operations. If you’ve ever been in a company that’s gone bankrupt or approached bankruptcy, you know that it incurs significant operational costs. Customers leave, employees leave, and financing becomes more of a strain. So, as leverage goes up, it’s more likely that firms will experience these operational costs and value will decrease, often very quickly given the precarious status of the firm. And the way these <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_131" aria-label="131"></span>costs begin destroying value, shown by the green line, will vary by the nature of the business. Very stable businesses won’t incur those costs until they’re at really high levels of leverage. In contrast, very risky businesses could incur costs of financial distress early on.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Capital Structure across Countries</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">If you look at three companies in different parts of the world—say, NextEra, an energy company in the United States; Tractebel Energia, one of the largest electricity companies in Brazil; and Electric Ireland, an electricity company in Ireland—you won’t see the same capital structure in each country.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Different countries have different tax rates, which influence the attractiveness of their debt. Additionally, the stability of cash flows to the businesses in these countries may be different, which will affect the costs and likelihood of financial distress. Companies need to consider the local conditions of the country they are in and balance the tax benefits of debt with the risks of financial distress in order to determine their optimal capital structure.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When we combine tax effects with the costs of financial distress with the red line, it becomes clear that weighing the tax benefits relative to the costs of financial distress will provide the value-maximizing capital structure. By implication, firms from different industries will have different capital structures that reflect a trade-off between tax benefits and the costs of financial distress associated with that underlying industry. That optimal capital structure for a given industry will provide the weights for costs of equity and debt we’ll use in the WACC calculation.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The cost of equity</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Isolating the cost of equity is a little harder. We can’t just ask equity holders for the return they’d like as we did with debt—most equity investors would only answer, “a lot.” If we can’t actually ask equity holders what their expected return is, how do we figure it out? Fortunately, there’s an elegant Nobel Prize–winning theory that contains many important intuitions to help us think through the cost of equity—the capital asset pricing model. This model follows the same logic as the cost of debt: a risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The amount equity investors charge for risk has two components: the quantity of risk of a given stock and the price of that risk. But how do we think about risk in this setting? Indeed, what is risk?</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h4 class="head d-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_132" aria-label="132"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">What is risk?</span> If you had to come up with a way to measure the risk of holding a given stock, what would it be? If you had all the data in the world, what would you try to isolate to figure out how much risk a given company exposes you to? You might think that the amount a company’s stock moves around—its variability—would be a great measure of risk. As seen in the box, “<a href="#box-pg119">Value Creation or Value Destruction?</a>” BP’s stock price performance moves around a great deal and you can measure how much it moves around—its volatility. If a stock is highly volatile and therefore creating a lot of uncertainty, then you would demand a higher rate of return. This intuition seems correct but overlooks an important insight that leads to a completely different answer.</h4>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Myths About Costs of Equity</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Two important myths are often repeated when people talk about costs of equity. One is that equity is relatively cheap compared to debt. That myth goes like this: “Well, if I don’t pay my debt holders, I go bankrupt. That’s expensive. If I don’t pay my equity holders, nothing happens. So equity is cheap.” The second, related myth says that equity is free: “I don’t have to give equity holders anything, so the cost of equity is zero.”</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Those two myths, while remarkably pervasive, are wrong because they don’t manifest some central intuitions on the relationship between risk and return. Which is riskier, equity or debt? When a company fails, debt holders get paid first and equity holders may get nothing. So equity holders are in a considerably riskier position. As a consequence of being in a riskier position, they’re going to demand a higher return, and it certainly won’t be zero. That’s the underlying intuition of the relationship between risk and return.</span></p>
</div>
<p>As discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, diversification provides a powerful way to manage risks because as you diversify, you can maintain expected returns and reduce risk—the only free lunch in finance. If investors hold diversified portfolios, the volatility of any one given stock doesn’t matter that much because much of that volatility gets washed away in the portfolio. As <a href="#fig4-4">figure 4-4</a> shows, as you add more securities to a portfolio, the overall volatility of the portfolio decreases. But there is a level above which the gains from diversification diminish. Most important, there is some volatility you can never fully diversify away; it is called systematic risk or the risk of holding the market.</p>
<p>Because so much of a given stock’s variability goes away within the context of a portfolio, we need only think about the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_133" aria-label="133"></span>risk that doesn’t disappear—the systematic risk. So every security’s risk is not measured by how much it moves around in general but rather by how much each stock moves with the market, which represents the risk that will never be diversified away.</p>

<p>The measure of how a stock moves with the market is called a beta. More precisely, if a company has a beta of 1, it generally moves in sync with the market; if the market goes up by 10 percent, then the company’s stock is likely to go up by 10 percent. If the company has a beta of 2 and the market goes up by 10 percent, then the company’s stock goes up by 20 percent. If a company has a beta of negative 1 and the market goes up by 10 percent, then the stock will go down by 10 percent. That’s what a beta is meant to capture: If the market goes up or down, how will the stock do?</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Calculating betas.</span> A beta is surprisingly simple to calculate. Take a look at <a href="#fig4-5">figure 4-5</a>, which plots the monthly returns for a given company against the monthly returns for the market.</h4>
<p>Every dot in the figure corresponds to a month and the associated returns for the market and the company during that month. Looking at the graph, where can you find the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_134" aria-label="134"></span>beta? Remember that a beta measures the correlation between a given company’s returns and the market’s returns. If you simply draw a line that best fits the data—also known as a regression—the slope of that line is going to capture what a beta is: literally how the company co-moves with the market.</p>
<p>Let’s take two well-known companies—the insurance company AIG and food retailer Yum! Brands, discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>—and try to find betas for them. The data in <a href="#fig4-6">figures 4-6</a> and <a href="#fig4-7">4-7</a> use monthly returns for both companies from January 2010 through July 2018, as compared to monthly returns for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period.</p>

<p>AIG’s equity beta is around 1.65, while Yum!’s is around 0.67. Why are the two betas so different? It helps to remember what beta is measuring—correlation with the overall market. Yum!’s restaurants—KFC and Taco Bell—sell relatively inexpensive food. Even in the worst recession, people will likely still eat there, but they may be more cost-conscious and frugal. When things get better and people have more money, they may order more there, but they may also upgrade from fast food to casual dining. So Yum! is fairly insulated from the variability of the economy.</p>

<p>AIG, on the other hand, provides insurance to companies to help them manage their financial risks. When times are bad, it often has many claims it needs to pay out, reducing its profits. In good times, it receives premiums paired with fewer claims and does much better. AIG’s investment of premiums paid performs better. As a result, AIG is more tightly bound to market performance.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_135" aria-label="135"></span>Now that you have an idea of what a beta is and where it comes from, let’s look at some industry-level betas. (See <a href="#tab4-6">table 4-6</a>.) Thinking about this at the industry level allows us to abstract from some of the variation at every given company.</p>
<p>Some of these industries have betas that are relatively high—higher than 1.0—which means that they move more than the market. Typically, cyclical industries look like this.</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The intuition behind betas.</span> The central intuition behind betas relates to insurance. High-beta companies expose shareholders to larger amounts of systematic risk that they can’t diversify away. Because of this, investors charge them a higher cost of equity. As a consequence, these firms have a higher weighted average cost of capital. And as a consequence of that, their values will be lower. That last step is the trickiest—if you apply high discount rates, what happens to present values? They become lower, so a high beta leads to a high cost of equity that leads to a high WACC that leads to lower values.</h4>
<p>For a negative beta company, the costs of equity are going to be low. They might even be negative, which means that their WACC will be lower, which means their values will be higher. When the market goes up, this asset will perform poorly. When the market does poorly, this asset will do really well. Negative beta assets are special because when the world falls apart, they really deliver for you. As a consequence, you <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_136" aria-label="136"></span>don’t demand much of a return from them, and that leads to high values.</p>
<p>In this sense, much of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is about insurance. You love the assets that move against the market because they provide you with insurance. And, if you’re risk averse, that’s a valuable thing. <a href="#fig4-8">Figure 4-8</a> plots the annual returns for gold compared to the annual returns for the S&amp;P 500 stock index, from 1988 to 2015. Remember, the beta is the slope of the line. Notice how the slope of the line is negative, unlike the slope of the line for AIG and Yum! Part of the attraction of investing in gold is that when the world falls apart, the gold (hopefully) will be there for you, and that insurance is valuable and would lead you to ask for low or negative returns.</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The price of risk.</span> Now that we can measure the quantity of risk associated with a company by using a beta, we need to combine the quantity of risk with a price of risk to figure out the cost of equity. That price of risk is also known as a market risk premium.</h4>
<p>People calculate this in different ways, but here’s one calculation that shows how we can think about the price of risk. Let’s consider the historic outperformance of equities versus a risk-free instrument like treasury bonds. As the table in the box “<a href="#box-pg124">An Introduction to Risk and Return</a>” demonstrates, equities outperform safe securities like government treasuries by a fair margin.</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig4-8"></a>

</figure>
<p>If equities outperform risk-free instruments by 6 percent on average, that must be the compensation to investors for exposure to that risk of the market. In effect, that outperformance is the price of risk—the compensation people demand for bearing equity risk—also known as the market risk premium.</p>

<p class="noindent">When we put together the ideas of the price of risk and the quantity of risk, we get an equation for the cost of equity.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Capital Asset Pricing Model</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg137.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>What can we discern from the cost of equity equation? First, at a minimum, investors will demand at least the risk-free rate or the amount that you charge when you lend money to the government. Second, there has to be some notion of a risk adjustment that will be composed of the quantity of risk and the price of risk. To measure the quantity of risk, you do not use volatility, as you might think. Because of the power of diversification and the free lunch it provides, you’re going to be concerned primarily with correlations, or betas. That, in combination with the price of risk, gives you the expected return for a given industry or company and, as a consequence, the cost of equity for those companies.</p>
<p>Let’s generate the cost of equity for the two companies under discussion: AIG and Yum! We’ll make some broad assumptions about the risk-free rate and the market risk premium: specifically, that the risk-free rate is 4 percent and the market risk premium is 7 percent. In this case, AIG has a cost of equity of 4% <span class="symbol">+</span> 1.65 <span class="symbol">×</span> 7% <span class="symbol">=</span> 15.55%, while Yum! has a cost of equity of 4% <span class="symbol">+</span> 0.67 <span class="symbol">×</span> 7% <span class="symbol">=</span> 8.69%.</p>
<p>It’s important to recall that these costs of equity are also the expected returns to the investors, which allows us to think about the essence of investment management. <a href="#fig4-9">Figure 4-9</a> graphs the equation for expected returns of equity. As betas increase, expected returns increase. Note that zero beta assets have an expected return equal to the risk-free rate. Active investment management is all about pursuing assets that deviate from the line and deliver more than the expected return. This gap is called <i>alpha</i>. Alpha is the source of value creation, as isolating it means you’re delivering greater-than- expected returns just as in the exercise at the beginning of <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>While the CAPM is a really powerful theory, it’s also predicated on several assumptions that don’t always hold. For example, it assumes no transaction costs and investors that are able to borrow and lend at relatively low rates, and many of these assumptions are inconsistent with reality. Most important, the theory relies on the idea that investors are highly rational—an assumption that has proven tenuous. Most concerning, it does not always appear that realized returns line up with betas as suggested by <a href="#fig4-9">figure 4-9</a>. While the capital asset <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_138" aria-label="138"></span>pricing model is hotly debated, it remains the cornerstone of the cost of equity and is a dominant framework for the investment management world.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Common Mistakes with WACC</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Now that we have thought through the intuitions behind the weights, the tax term, and the costs of debt and equity, we can now use the WACC to value investments. In effect, the discount rate emphasized in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a> will be the WACC as we move forward. The intuition for WACC is slippery, so it’s useful to think through three common misconceptions about costs of capital in order to build our intuition further.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Using the same cost of capital for all investments</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first big mistake managers make is to use the same cost of capital for all the projects they invest in. The logic usually goes something like this: “Well, my capital providers have expected returns, so the cost of capital, <i>no matter what I invest in</i>, has to be the same for all my investment projects.”</p>
<p>This logic is powerful, but it’s wrong. Imagine a conglomerate that invests in different industries. Should it use the same cost of capital across those different industries? All those various industries and investments expose their capital providers to different risks, so every industry requires a different cost of capital. To see why, consider what would happen if a firm used the same cost of capital for all its divisions.</p>
<p>Imagine that a conglomerate invests in three different industries—aerospace, health-care, and media—with three different betas. If you use one cost of capital—let’s say the average cost of capital—across multiple divisions with different betas, what mistakes will you make? Which divisions will you overinvest in and which industries will you underinvest in? (See <a href="#fig4-10">figure 4-10</a>.)</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig4-10"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 4-10</span></p>
<p class="FIGT"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">The cost of capital and betas in three industries</span></p>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="../Images/Figure_04-10.svg"><img src="../Images/Figure_04-10.jpg" alt="" width="983" height="705"/></object>
</figure>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_139" aria-label="139"></span>What mistakes will you make when investing in the media industry? In that situation, the correct cost of capital is actually higher than what you’re using if you have the same one for all investments. As a consequence, you give too much credit to projects in that industry, so you end up overinvesting in those businesses. Similarly, for aerospace, the cost of capital you should use is lower than the one to use if you have the same one for all industries. As a consequence, you’re penalizing those investment opportunities too much and end up underinvesting.</p>
<p>One final way to understand this intuition is “it’s not about you”—the hardest lesson in life. The appropriate cost of capital isn’t a function of <i>who</i> is investing but rather a function of <i>what</i> you’re investing in. Risk is embedded in the asset, not the investor.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Lowering your WACC by using more debt</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Another appealing, but incorrect, intuition is that a company can lower its WACC by using more debt, given that debt has a lower cost than equity. The thinking usually goes like this: “Debt is typically cheaper, and with a tax advantage, even more so. So if I just use more debt, I’ll reduce my WACC and, as a result, I’ll end up having a higher value.”</p>
<p>That’s wrong. There is no free lunch here. If a company is at the optimal capital structure described above, it can’t simply take on more debt because it’s cheaper and think that’s smart. Equity holders will demand a higher return for that risk, and that will actually offset any benefit from using more debt.</p>
<p><a href="#fig4-11">Figure 4-11</a>—the most difficult figure in this book—will help you see that WACCs can’t simply be lowered by taking on more debt. The figure shows what happens to betas on the vertical axis as the amount of debt used increases on the horizontal axis. One key difference from what we’ve seen previously is that there are three types of betas on the graph: equity betas, debt betas, and asset betas.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_140" aria-label="140"></span>Remember that a beta is a measure of the correlation between an instrument’s returns and the market’s. First, let’s think about the asset beta, which measures how the operating assets co-move with the market’s returns. How does an asset beta change as you use more debt? The answer is that it doesn’t change. The behavior of the assets relative to the market doesn’t change as financing changes. This is similar to the intuition for the flat line in <a href="#fig4-3">figure 4-3</a>. What do you think happens to debt betas and equity betas as a company increases its reliance on debt? To think this through, consider the extremes: What happens when the firm is fully equity-financed? What about when it uses very little equity? To consider this further, anchor your thinking in the beta of the business—the asset beta as well.</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig4-11"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 4-11</span></p>
<p class="FIGT"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">Asset betas, debt betas, and equity betas as a function of leverage</span></p>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="../Images/Figure_04-11.svg"><img src="../Images/Figure_04-11.jpg" alt="" width="798" height="797"/></object>
</figure>
<p>The orange curve represents what we think of as debt betas. When a company takes on that first dollar of debt, it’s relatively risk-free, so debt betas are close to 0. As a company approaches complete debt financing, debt betas approach the level of asset betas as the company is entirely debt-financed. The final piece is, what do equity betas look like? When there’s no debt or very little debt, equity betas look a lot like asset betas. And what happens as leverage increases? Equity betas shoot up as the equity has become more risky and therefore more expensive.</p>
<p>This is the core idea in <a href="#fig4-11">figure 4-11</a>. A company at its optimal capital structure can’t simply switch from equity to debt and expect its cost of capital to go down. Why? Equity holders will penalize the company by raising their expected return, thereby undoing the benefits of using more debt.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Exporting WACC</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The final mistake managers make is thinking that they can add value by buying another company and applying their WACC to its cash flows. Here’s how their thinking works: “I’m bidding for an asset. Another company is also bidding <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_141" aria-label="141"></span>for an asset. I’ve got a lower cost of capital than they do because of my businesses. I’m going to be able to get this deal done and actually win the bid because I’ll be using my cost of capital, which is lower than theirs.”</p>
<p>The right cost of capital has nothing to do with the company or the alternative bidder. The right cost of capital has everything to do with the asset that the managers are buying, and that should be the same for the two buyers. There’s no way the company can export its cost of capital to that asset. The cost of capital is not about who you are. It’s about what you’re investing in.</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Corporate CFOs try to be very clear about what they consider their optimal capital structure and try to credibly return to it when circumstances change. Laurence Debroux, CFO of Heineken, commented:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">At Heineken, we have promised ourselves and the rating agencies publicly that our net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio has to be 2.5, and whatever we do, we need to be able to bring it back to 2.5 in a short time. This has the merit of being clear, so when people invest in Heineken, they know what they’re getting. They’re not getting massive share buybacks and large debt. They also know that there is a margin and some room to maneuver in terms of acquisitions if something can actually be a good acquisition to increase the portfolio.</span></p>

<p>As a consequence, it doesn’t matter if you plan to use the cash on your balance sheet to make an acquisition or if you have a highly levered or all-equity balance sheet. What matters is using the right cost of capital for that investment, and that cost of capital should reflect the right capital structure for that investment.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Corning Glass and Return on Capital (ROC)</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Corning was the leader in making display glass for electronics, and after examining the company’s financials and what the future held, equity analyst Alberto Moel determined that the company was trading below book value. As we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, the market at large thought that the company would not surpass its cost of capital with its returns.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>For a company trading below its book value, like Corning, some might argue that it should shut down and sell its assets, especially if it can sell them for close to book value.</b> <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_142" aria-label="142"></span><b>Why do you think Corning continued to run its business despite a ROC less than its cost of capital?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">Corning likely believed, as Moel did, that the market was mispricing its future performance and that its future performance would be considerably better. Corning’s market value was below its book value because it was facing pricing pressure in the market, which reduced its ROC. So the question is: Were these price pressures permanent or temporary?</p>
<p>This question returns us to core strategic business concerns. If Corning believes that its work adds value to its product and that it can protect its operations in a competitive environment, it should be confident that pricing pressures will be temporary. If the underlying conditions have changed, then it should analyze whether shutting down is the right decision for its shareholders.</p>
<p>Moel agreed that there was price pressure. However, when he looked at Corning’s in-depth cost structure, he saw that the pricing pressure could be offset or even improved by its cost structure. In other words, its margins could remain flat or expand. The market didn’t see this, so the expectations that Corning’s margins would continue to compress were negatively affecting the stock price.</p>
<p>Therefore, Moel thought that the ROC of Corning was going to be better than the market thought and that in the future, Corning would trade above book value. In the end, he recommended “buy” to his investors.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Part of the reason Corning’s market value was below its book value was that investors believed that their margins would continue to compress, which Moel disagreed with. Why do you think there is a tendency, in forecasting, to assume that current changes (reduced margins) will continue indefinitely into the future?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">Forecasting the future is inherently difficult, and every decision the analyst makes carries the risk of being wrong. Faced with this difficulty, many analysts choose assumptions that extrapolate existing trends to determine future cash flows. Such reasoning may feel conservative but, in fact, is quite radical relative to thinking through the product or economic cycle.</p>
<p>Valuation is difficult because you have to consider everything about a company—its intellectual property, its strategy, its competitive landscape, and so on—and translate that into numbers and then forecast those numbers into the future. It’s a thorough, complicated process that can take weeks. Then you have to write a convincing report. And, finally, you have to be right most of the time.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_143" aria-label="143"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Biogen’s Capital Structure</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">In 2015, due in part to low interest rates, Biogen took on $6 billion in debt in order to repurchase $5 billion of its own shares. This changed its capital structure; the net effect would be similar to not issuing those shares in the first place and taking on debt instead to purchase assets. The share repurchase was a way of returning cash to shareholders and providing them with more ownership after Biogen had grown significantly in recent years.</p>
<p>But what about the debt? According to Paul Clancy, Biogen’s CFO at the time, taking on that much debt was rare for the pharma company. At the time, it had only $500 million dollars of debt on the balance sheet. However, like many other biotechnology companies, Biogen had cash trapped outside the United States that was inaccessible. So it had to take on some debt in order to execute the share repurchase. But it also took on more than it needed because interest rates were very favorable at the time. Since share repurchases or acquisitions were in the pipeline, it wanted to lock in a good interest rate before rates rose.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Why would low interest rates encourage companies to take on more debt?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">The recent past has featured historically low interest rates. As such, firms may decide to lever up opportunistically in reaction to these conditions. The decision to time the issuance of equities or debt to market conditions is known as “market timing.” In effect, firms are betting that they have the ability to time when the issuance of securities or share buybacks is most advantageous.</p>
<p>In order for the bet to pay off, Biogen’s cash flows and pipeline products had to beat expectations. Of course, worrying about bets is the job of the CFO. Clancy commented: “If you’re not worried about those types of bets, you’re not being responsible to shareholders and to shareholder value creation.”</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>When investors purchase a share of stock in a company, they are making a bet that the company will perform better than its cost of capital, and that the stock will increase in value by more than just its expected return. Here, Clancy is suggesting that a company buying back its own shares is making a similar bet. Why?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">By spending cash to repurchase its own stock, the company is making an investment. As with any investment, that decision needs to have a positive net present value (NPV). Otherwise, Biogen should consider alternative uses of its capital, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_144" aria-label="144"></span>including simply distributing it as dividends. We’ll discuss this broader capital allocation question in <a href="../Text/chapter_6.xhtml">chapter 6</a>.</p>
<p>One job of the CFO is to invest in the operating expenses that drive the business forward. This isn’t always easy, especially in a big organization where people have different opinions and competing interests. The CFO’s job is to get everyone on the same page. “When strategy gets focused,” Clancy said, “it’s actually easier all the way through an organization to discern the difference between what is really a good investment and what is not.”</p>
<p>After the repurchase program and taking on more debt, Biogen had to execute a restructuring to ensure it was deploying its resources in the right way. This was a tough message to deliver to employees, especially since the company had just bought back $5 billion in shares.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Do you think it is appropriate for Biogen to restructure its company through layoffs while simultaneously announcing a $5 billion share repurchase? Why or why not?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">On the one hand, these are independent decisions—one is about making sure you’re operating as efficiently as possible and should be undertaken no matter what the financing decisions are. On the other hand, the coincidence of these occurrences will raise questions about why more capital expenditures (and the associated jobs) weren’t a primary objective. Finance is at the crosshairs of these decisions, making Clancy’s ability to speak to capital markets and to employees critical. CFOs increasingly play a central role because of the importance of the decisions and their own ability to address efficiency as well as capital allocation—the subject of <a href="../Text/chapter_6.xhtml">chapter 6</a>.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Heineken: Building a Mexican Brewery</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">In 2015, Heineken decided to invest $470 million in a new brewery in the Chihuahua region of Mexico, a key strategic move designed with a long-term view toward value creation. Let’s look at the factors Heineken considered when making this decision.</p>
<p>According to Laurence Debroux, Heineken’s CFO, the beverage giant first made inroads into Mexico in 2012 when it acquired the brewing operations of Femsa, a large Mexican conglomerate. At first glance, moving into Mexico might seem an odd choice for Heineken, which is based in the Netherlands, but it had many compelling strategic reasons to do so. Mexico is a large market, twice the size of Heineken’s number-two market, and the country’s GDP growth, in contrast to developed nations, was more promising.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_145" aria-label="145"></span>Demographics were also promising. As many young people in Mexico reached legal drinking age, they became consumers. Mexican and craft beer in the United States was also growing, while the traditional beer market in the United States was stagnant. With the acquisition of Femsa, and its Mexican operation, Tecate, Heineken controlled Tecate Light and Dos Equis, two brands that were growing quickly in the United States and perhaps Europe in the future. For these reasons, Debroux and her colleagues invested in a new factory, which ended up being one of largest investments in Heineken’s history.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Why do you think CFOs like Debroux tend to look at strategic concerns before they look at the NPV of a project? If value creation means choosing projects with a positive NPV, what does strategic analysis achieve?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">Strategic analysis can help CFOs focus their attention on projects most likely to produce positive NPVs. Creating a forecast for projects requires understanding the overall strategic importance of a project and the interaction of that project with the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>Debroux had to determine the right capacity. How big should the factory be? You don’t want to underinvest and miss out on revenues and sales. “Of course,” as Debroux described, “it’s a good problem—it’s a problem that we want to have because if we ask ourselves in five years, should we build another one, that means that we’re selling more and more in that country.” But underestimating capacity can come at great cost.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>When designing a new brewery, Debroux needed to balance future capacity with the current cost of construction. Thinking about costs of capital and the time value of money, what do you think her concerns were?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">Heineken would incur the costs to build the brewery now, while it would gain the benefits from increased capacity in the future. Cash flows far into the future, when discounted, might not be worth the expense today. For this reason, Debroux constantly needs to balance the increased cash flows of future capacity with their cost today. As she commented, “When you look at a new brewery, you have the supply-chain employees in the driver’s seat, and they have so much experience in a company like Heineken that they will tell you precisely how much the project is going to cost and how complicated it is going to be.”</p>
<p>Since Heineken’s supply-chain employees had a wealth of experience, they were usually accurate with their cost estimates and how long a project would take to build. From there, Debroux took those numbers, along with her assumptions about sales and productivity, and built a classical financial <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_146" aria-label="146"></span>model, paying particular attention to NPV and the internal rate of return. When performing calculations like this, companies have rules and benchmarks. For example, depending on the project, if a company doesn’t see itself recouping its initial investment in, say, five to seven years, then it may deem the project too risky. Projects often look good in isolation, but if the numbers look too good to be true and don’t match up with similar projects, then it’s possible the company is overlooking something. “But it is still a good question to ask yourself,” said Lebroux. “If the project is all dependent on reaching a level of profitability or an EBITDA revenue that you don’t see anywhere else in your company, you have to ask yourself, why would I reach it there, and I haven’t reached it anywhere else?” That’s an important conversation to have.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What if your forecasted cash flows are wrong? What if the brewery underperforms expectations? Think back to the lessons about sunk costs and the Sakai plant that Sharp built. What are the options?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">If the brewery underperforms expectations, it may still have a positive present value. The costs to build the brewery are sunk costs, so they should have no relevance for the decision on what to do with the brewery once it is built. Every decision—whether to sell the brewery, modify its operations, and so on—is a new decision for which the company should construct a new NPV.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Chapter Summary</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we developed a number of difficult but foundational ideas. First, we identified where value comes from and the specific recipe for value creation. Companies have to beat their cost of capital. They have to keep doing it, and they have to grow. The <i>sine qua non</i> of value creation is beating the cost of capital.</p>
<p>What does it mean to talk about a cost of capital? The first big idea is that costs of capital are associated with the expected returns of capital providers. And those expected returns are dictated by the risk investors bear. So a WACC says that for a given investment, you need to figure out what the debt and equity providers demand and average those costs of debt and equity by their weights. What are those weights? It depends on the industry. You tax-adjust them, because interest payments are tax deductible.</p>
<p>Next is the idea of the capital asset pricing model. The costs of equity aren’t explicit. You need to rely on something to think rigorously about these costs. Because we live in a world with diversification opportunities, betas, rather than volatilities, of investments best measure the risk presented by an asset.</p>
<p>The final idea is that you have to use the WACC with care. It’s not something that you can just export to other investments. And you can’t use the same WACC for all investments. Finally, you can’t simply increase firm value by taking on more debt than the optimal capital structure.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will first combine the WACC and the idea of free cash flows to create the foundation of valuation and then build upon that foundation to consider how to value assets in general.</p>
