<h2 class="chapter-subtitle" role="doc-subtitle"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Why finance is obsessed with cash and the future</span></h2>
</hgroup>
<p class="noindent"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_53" aria-label="53"></span>Accounting statements are critically important for understanding corporate performance, but they have drawbacks. In reaction to those drawbacks, the field of finance has developed a distinctive approach to making decisions and analyzing performance.</p>
<p>That approach has two pillars. First, finance practitioners have questioned the best way to measure economic returns. While accounting emphasizes net profit, finance professionals consider net profit flawed, as it ignores several important issues. Finding solutions to these problems has caused finance professionals to turn toward cash as a better measure of economic returns. Indeed, they can sometimes be obsessed with cash.</p>
<p>Cash can mean many things, so we’ll explore three alternative definitions of cash—earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); operating cash flow; and free cash flow. And we’ll discover why free cash flow is so important for thinking about investment decisions and valuation decisions—and why it represents finance nirvana.</p>
<p>Second, the field of finance is preoccupied with the future and is fundamentally forward looking. This leads us away from the balance sheet in an attempt to answer some of the biggest questions in finance: How much are assets worth? Where does value come from? How do we measure value that arises from future cash flows? This focus on the future <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_55" aria-label="55"></span>leads us to consider the time value of money and methods for translating future cash flows into the present, which will be foundational in thinking about any investment or valuation decision.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Finance takes issue with two of the foundations of accounting: conservatism and accrual accounting.</span></p>
<p class="BSH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">The Conservatism Principle</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The conservatism principle implies that companies should record lower estimated values of their assets and, by extension, higher estimates of their liabilities—in short, they err on the side of being conservative. Thus, balance sheets typically record assets at their historical cost, not their current or replacement value, and many assets simply don’t show up on their books. Apple’s balance sheet in 2016, for instance, valued its brand at $0 even as</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">Forbes</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">valued the forty-year-old brand at $154.1 billion. Which do you think is closer to reality?</span></p>
<p class="BSH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">The Rules of Accrual Accounting</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The rules of accrual accounting try to smooth out both revenues and costs in an effort to better reflect economic reality. They allow a company to capitalize an investment as an asset, and to expense it as depreciation charges every year over the asset’s entire life, for instance. For example, Airbus Group, the European aerospace and defense manufacturer, built a new factory in Mobile, Alabama, that cost $600 million. Because of accrual accounting, Airbus would report more moderate profits over time rather than losses in 2015 and then profits after the plant started production. But this representation of profits is quite distinct from their true cash outflows, obscures the time value of money, and may reflect managerial discretion while cash flows would not.</span></p>

<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Laurence Debroux, CFO of Heineken, commented on the importance of cash:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">I always remember this sentence: revenue is vanity, result is sanity, and cash is king. Emphasizing only the growth of revenues can be ridiculous and dangerous. Measuring only on the growth of profit would also be dangerous. Cash is the most important. Your capacity to transform your business into cash that you can use to finance your activities, repay your debt, or distribute to your shareholders is the key.</span></p>
</div>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">What We Talk about When We Talk about Cash</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">In <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>, we used net profit to measure corporate performance. Although net profit has merits—it’s a powerful measure for thinking about how shareholders have been doing—it has problems. First, it treats cash and noncash expenses symmetrically. Second, net profit also subtracts interest payments, which makes it hard to compare companies that finance themselves in different ways even though their operations could be quite similar.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, many managerial decisions are involved in calculating profit. Accounting asks managers to make decisions in order to smooth returns, as accountants consider that to be more consistent with reality. For example, an up-front payment for a piece of equipment has to be capitalized, placed on the balance sheet, and then depreciated over time. Revenue similarly may need to be recognized over time. But this process of smoothing measures of performance is subjective, which allows managers to manipulate profits to their advantage. In contrast, cash is cash and, arguably, is not susceptible to similar levels of managerial discretion.</p>
<p>To build an alternative foundation for assessing economic returns, we need to identify cash flows as opposed to profits. But what do we mean when we say “cash”? Frustratingly, it turns out that the answer is “it depends.” We’ll begin where we left off in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>—with EBIT and EBITDA—and then build up to operating cash flows and, finally, to finance nirvana: free cash flow.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">EBIT Equation</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg55.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>As we saw, EBIT (or operating profit) gives a clearer view of how efficient and profitable a company is relative to net profit by not subtracting interest and taxes, which are not related to operational performance. EBIT still isn’t quite a measure of cash, however, because it is calculated after subtracting noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. For a fuller picture, finance professionals <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_56" aria-label="56"></span>turn to EBITDA: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">EBITDA Equation</span></p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Amazon’s Net Profit, EBIT, and EBITDA</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">Amazon provides a compelling example of the distinction between these three different measures. (See <a href="#tab2-1">table 2-1</a>.)</p>
<p>In 2014, Amazon’s net profit was <span class="symbol">−</span>$241 million. Amazon’s EBIT, however, was $178 million, and the difference of $419 million represents taxes, interest, and currency adjustments. What about EBITDA? Because of a whopping $4.746 billion in depreciation and amortization, the EBITDA here is $4.924 billion—a far cry from the net loss of $278 million. So Amazon generated lots of cash, as measured by EBITDA, but had losses according to profitability measures.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">From EBITDA to Operating Cash Flows</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">Given the obsession with cash, it’s not surprising that there is a separate financial statement dedicated to it: the statement of cash flows. Many finance professionals consider the statement of cash flows a company’s most important financial statement. Rather than focusing on the income statement, which has the problems of noncash expenses and managerial discretion, or a balance sheet, which has the problems of historical cost accounting and conservatism, many people in finance focus on the statement of cash flows because it looks purely at cash.</p>
<p>Typically, a statement of cash flows has three parts: operating, investing, and financing sections. The first section, operating cash flows, provides both the next measure of cash <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_57" aria-label="57"></span>and brings together many of the elements that we’ve already discussed. In particular, recall from <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a> how Timberland managed its inventory and receivables to generate cash. More generally, working capital—receivables, inventories, and payables—can have significant cash flow consequences.</p>
<div class="ora">
<p class="RT"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Reflections</span></p>
<p class="RI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">EBITDA can be more relevant for some industries than others. Consider three companies: Electronic Arts (EA), the video games developer; The Michaels Companies, an arts and crafts retail chain; and Comcast, the internet, telephone, and cable television provider. Which of these companies is going to have the greatest amount of depreciation and amortization, and why?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One way to appreciate the difference that depreciation makes is to compare it to net profit. In 2015, the depreciation-to-net income ratios of EA, The Michaels Companies, and Comcast were 17 percent, 34 percent, and 106 percent, respectively. That’s logical; unlike EA, a software company, Comcast has invested heavily to create a nationwide cable and internet network. Because of those heavy investments, using net profit as a measure of performance can result in a distorted picture and flawed comparisons. The Michaels Companies is somewhere between EA and Comcast, given its brick-and-mortar footprint.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Operating Cash Flow Equation</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg57.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>Operating cash flow is distinct from EBITDA in several ways. First and foremost, it considers the costs of working capital, and, second, it accounts for tax and interest payments by beginning with net profit. And finally, it includes noncash expenses other than depreciation and amortization, such as share-based compensation, in its final calculation.</p>
<p>What about the rest of the cash flow statement? Briefly, the investing section of the cash flow statement emphasizes the ongoing investments that bypass the income statement <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_58" aria-label="58"></span>and go straight into the balance sheet, such as capital expenditures and acquisitions. The financing section examines whether a company has offered debt or paid back debt or issued equity or bought back stock, and reveals the cash consequences of doing so. <a href="#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a> provides a generic statement of cash flows along with Starbucks’ 2017 data. As the figure demonstrates, the statement maps how cash positions changed over the course of the year because of operating performance along with investing and financing decisions.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Working capital</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Working capital, the capital that companies use to fund their day-to-day operations, is critical to understanding operating cash flows. While you might think of finance as associated only with debt and equity, finance is deeply embedded in the daily operations of a business.</p>
<figure class="EQ-IMG"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg58.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_59" aria-label="59"></span>While working capital is a general term for the difference between current assets and current liabilities, it usually emphasizes three important components: accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. Here’s a quick recap of these accounting categorizations:</p>
<p class="d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Accounts receivable.</span> Accounts receivable are amounts that customers, typically other businesses, owe a company. The dollar amount can be reframed as a receivables collection period, which shows the average number of days it takes for customers to pay the company.</p>
<p class="d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Inventory.</span> The goods, and the associated inputs, held by a company prior to sale all count toward inventory. Based on inventory, you can generate a days inventory, which shows the average number of days that the company holds inputs and goods.</p>
<p class="d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Accounts payable.</span> The amounts a company owes to suppliers are accounts payable. Based on that, you can generate a days payable, which indicates the average number of days the company takes to pay suppliers.</p>
<p>A slightly more narrow way to define working capital is:</p>
<figure class="EQ-IMG"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg59.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>One simple way to think about the consequences of working capital is to note that the daily operations of a company result in an amount that needs to be financed, like any other asset. If the amount of working capital is lowered, that lowers the financing needs of a corporation. So the way you manage working capital has deep financial consequences.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The cash conversion cycle</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">A powerful way to frame the financing consequences of working capital is to frame working capital temporally rather than monetarily. This framing is called the cash conversion cycle.</p>
<p>To see the cash conversion cycle in action, imagine that you run a hardware store and all that you do is buy hammers from wholesalers and sell them to home improvement professionals. Several transactions are associated with a single hammer, and they don’t happen at the same time. You have to buy the hammer, pay for it, sell it, and collect the cash for that sale. Let’s say you sell the hammer seventy days after you bought it, and you don’t get paid until forty days after the sale. Those figures correspond to a days inventory of seventy days and a receivables collection period of forty days. From a business perspective, this means that 110 days elapse from <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_60" aria-label="60"></span>the time you buy a hammer to getting cash for it. In addition, you didn’t pay cash for that hammer until thirty days after buying it.</p>
<div class="ora">
<p class="RT"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Reflections</span></p>
<p class="RI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">You have been tasked with managing the working capital for one of Home Depot’s stores in Atlanta. Currently, its days inventory is fifty days, the receivables collection period is twenty days, and its payables period is twenty-five days, which leaves a financing gap of forty-five days. How would you use your knowledge of the cash conversion cycle to reduce the store’s financing gap?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">You could:</span></p>
<ul class="RNU">
<li class="RNU"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Reduce the days inventory.</span></li>
<li class="RNU"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Reduce the receivables collection period.</span></li>
<li class="RNU"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Increase the payables period.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="RD"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">What are the trade-offs in reducing the store’s days inventory? Why would you want to do it, and why would you consider not doing so?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One of the easiest ways of reducing the days inventory is to stock less inventory; you can be certain that the store will sell out faster and you will need less financing. However, the danger is that if customers can’t find a certain brand of paint or kind of tool in your store, they will go to your rivals and may never come back.</span></p>
<p class="RD"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">What are the trade-offs in reducing your receivables collection period?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">You can reduce your receivables collection period by extending less credit to customers. However, those customers may need, or be used to receiving, credit from their suppliers; without it, they may prefer to buy from Home Depot’s rivals.</span></p>
<p class="RD"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">What are the trade-offs in increasing your payables period?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Paying suppliers late may erode relationships; they may become reluctant to supply products or be less willing to extend credit. If a hurricane were threatening to hit Atlanta, and everyone needed more supplies, your vendors might be more interested in working with your rivals than with you.</span></p>
</div>
<p>From a cash perspective, you need to generate cash to pay for the hammer eighty days before receiving the cash. If companies <i>pay</i> before getting <i>paid</i>, they must finance the shortfalls in their cash conversion cycles. None of this shows up in the measure of net profit or EBITDA. So just buying and selling hammers creates a financing need. (See <a href="#fig2-2">figure 2-2</a>.)</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig2-2"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_61" aria-label="61"></span><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 2-2</span></p>

</figure>
<p>The gap in the cash conversion cycle raises several questions. How much is this gap going to cost to finance? How can the company change behaviors to reduce those costs? Will those changes cost more than the savings?</p>
<p>To better understand the underlying dynamics of a working capital cycle, imagine what happens in a recession. Companies hold on to their inventory longer, and even when they do sell a hammer, that contractor, who is getting squeezed by his customers will take longer to pay up. The whole cash conversion cycle expands, which is what occurred during the financial crisis in 2008. The recession increased days inventory and collection periods, and since banks were recoiling, there was no mechanism to finance those large gaps. That’s why global trade collapsed by 50 percent in 2008.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the hardware store. A supplier encourages you to pay within ten days by offering a 2 percent discount— a fairly typical offer. Is that a good deal?</p>
<p>While it’s tempting to have a knee-jerk response to this offer, you don’t have enough information to answer that question. This is a financing decision and requires consideration of alternative methods of financing. Since you’d be paying the supplier in ten days instead of thirty, you’d need to finance the twenty-day gap. Who is a cheaper source of financing for those twenty days—the bank or the supplier? Let’s imagine that your bank charges an annual interest rate of 12 percent per year, which would be less than 1 percent for twenty days of financing. This means you would pay less than 1 percent to fund those twenty days if you took the deal from the supplier and used the bank to fund your cash conversion cycle.</p>
<p>The discount offered by the supplier can be reframed as a financing cost for those twenty days. If you refuse the discount, you give up 2 percent and you receive twenty days of financing. In effect, the supplier is charging 2 percent for a twenty-day loan. Would you rather pay 2 percent for a twenty-day loan or less than 1 percent for a twenty-day loan? The answer, of course, is less than 1 percent. The bank financing is cheaper; you should take the deal from the supplier and borrow from the bank for those twenty days.</p>

<p class="TNI1">To see the power of working capital for the financial model of a company, let’s return to the example of Amazon. Amazon actually manages its inventory, receivables, and payables in such a way that it ends up with what’s called a negative working capital cycle, or negative cash conversion cycle. In the hardware store example, the store has a financing need created by its operations. Imagine if you lived in a world where buying and selling hammers wasn’t a drain on cash, but buying and selling hammers actually <i>generated</i> cash. That’s exactly the case with Amazon.</p>
<p>In 2014, Amazon averaged forty-six days of inventory, and it collected from its customers after twenty-one days on average (slightly long for a retailer because it reflects its cloud computing business). The icing on the cake is that Amazon, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_63" aria-label="63"></span>due to its market dominance, can exert a large amount of power over its suppliers to make them wait before getting paid, and it averaged ninety-one days to pay its suppliers. That reflects a negative cash conversion cycle of twenty-four days.</p>
<div class="ora">
<p class="RT"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Reflections</span></p>
<p class="RI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Say your company pays vendors in forty days and the prevailing interest rate is 20 percent. A supplier offers a 1 percent discount if you meet your obligations within ten days. Would you take the deal? Why?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">On the one hand, the supplier is charging you an implicit interest rate of 1 percent for a thirty-day loan. On the other, the bank will charge an interest rate of well over 1 percent for thirty days (20 percent per twelve months). The supplier’s financing is cheaper, so you should take the financing from the supplier, not the bank. In other words, don’t take the deal.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The upshot for Amazon is that its operations become a source of cash. Amazon—and Apple, for that matter—have working capital cycles that allow them to grow rapidly without seeking external financing. That’s another way of saying the cash they generate from their working capital becomes a powerful part of their business model.</p>

<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Laurence Debroux, CFO of Heineken, commented on the importance of working capital:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Thinking about your working capital is good hygiene. You can always improve. At the same time, you should not become addicted, because it can lead to behaviors that you don’t want to see. And that’s true for sales and for purchasers: you have to be very careful.</span></p>
<p class="BSTX1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">At Heineken, we operate in eighty countries and want to operate with local procurement, so we really have to have a long-term, sustainable approach to our relationships with suppliers. If you insist on squeezing every last bit from every supplier in an effort to improve your working capital, then you’re going to end up killing those suppliers. This is not the ecosystem you really want to live in. So working capital is important; you need to look at it. At the same time, you need to be sure of the consequences that you’re triggering when you actually push harder in working capital.</span></p>

<p>In effect, suppliers are financing Amazon’s and Apple’s growth. Both companies are substituting cheaper sources of <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_64" aria-label="64"></span>financing in the working capital cycle for external sources of financing. And that working capital consequence is a powerful dimension of their economic returns, which are not captured in EBITDA, or EBIT, or net profit.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Finally, Free Cash Flows</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">The final cash measure is free cash flows, one of the most important measures of economic performance in finance. You’ll see this number again and again when you look at how companies are valued or when companies discuss how they’re doing.</p>
<p>The equation for calculating free cash flows provides a measure of the amount of cash flows truly unencumbered by the operations of a business. It’s the purest measure of cash and <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_65" aria-label="65"></span>forms the basis of valuation. It removes the distorting effects of noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization (like EBITDA), accounts for changes in working capital (like operating cash flow), and, finally, acknowledges that capital expenditures are required for growth and have been avoided so far. In short, free cash flow isolates the cash that is truly free to be distributed or used however the company sees fit.</p>

<figure class="EQ"><img width="300" src="../Images/pg65.jpg" alt=""/></figure>


<p>To calculate free cash flow, let’s start with EBIT to get a sense of operational performance. Since this has to be <i>free</i> cash flow, you need to account for taxes, which results in the next acronym, EBIAT, or earnings before interest after taxes. Then, add back those noncash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization. Second, penalize the company if its working capital needs are such that you must constantly invest capital into the working capital cycle. That’s what we saw with operating cash flows. Third, make sure you subtract any planned or required capital expenditures on an ongoing basis, because that is a cash charge not yet considered.</p>
<p><a href="#fig2-3">Figure 2-3</a> provides a diagram and equation for understanding free cash flow. You can visualize it by thinking about a simplified balance sheet. The net assets side of the balance sheet is divided between working capital (e.g., inventories and accounts receivables less accounts payable) and fixed assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment), and the financing side of the balance sheet is divided between debt and equity. This modified balance sheet now distinguishes between the operations (the left-hand side) and the capital providers’ (the right-hand side). The flows that operations generate that end up with the capital providers are the free cash flows, which are calculated as follows. The operations of a business generate EBIT, but the government takes its <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_66" aria-label="66"></span>share to make it EBIAT. From there, you must consider the company’s ongoing investments into working capital and fixed assets as it grows. Finally, noncash expenses such as depreciation and amortization should never have been expensed and must be added back. What’s left is free cash flows.</p>

<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">First, cloud computing might have a different level of profitability than Amazon’s retail operations, which would impact its EBIT. Prepayments by cloud computing subscribers would change its working capital cycle relative to a retail operation. Finally, Amazon may need to spend more on capital expenditures to build server farms, which will also result in different amounts of subsequent depreciation.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Finance has slowly been moving toward free cash flow for evaluating returns over the last fifty years. Why? Because it captures all the cash consequences of a business, and it ensures that the underlying flows are free to the capital providers. <a href="#fig2-4">Figure 2-4</a> provides a timeline that shows how, since the 1960s, attention has shifted from revenues to profits to EBITDA to operating cash flows to free cash flows, and what distinguishes these different measures.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_67" aria-label="67"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Amazon versus Netflix</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">Before moving on to the next big element of the finance perspective—looking to the future—let’s see why taking a cash perspective can yield so much insight. Let’s compare two leading companies—Amazon and Netflix—by looking at their revenue numbers. (See <a href="#fig2-5">figures 2-5</a> and <a href="#fig2-6">2-6</a>.)</p>
<p>The scales are different (Amazon is a much bigger company than Netflix), but it’s clear that, between 2001 and 2017, both companies grew impressively. But that’s just revenues. Let’s look at a few more financial indicators. (See <a href="#fig2-7">figures 2-7</a> and <a href="#fig2-8">2-8</a>.)</p>
<p>Amazon seems not to have made profits, at least until very recently. By the profits metric, Netflix appears to be more profitable than Amazon, with a profit margin of nearly 5 percent relative to Amazon’s profit margin of less than 2 percent.</p>
<p>Now, look at their operating cash flows. Here things start to diverge, and we see the benefits of looking at these other measures. What’s going on here? In Amazon’s case, the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_68" aria-label="68"></span>cash flow engine is being driven by all its noncash expenses and its management of working capital. On the other hand, what’s happening to Netflix? Those profits are now translating into negative operating cash flows because of its heavy investments in content. In short, they are buying increasing amounts of content and quickly amortizing it, creating a cash drain. The story told by operating cash flow is totally different from that told by profits.</p>

<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_69" aria-label="69"></span>Finally, let’s look at their free cash flows. Considering capital expenditures changes the view a bit more. Netflix doesn’t have significant capital expenditures, so free cash flows aren’t considerably worse than operating cash flows. Amazon has more significant capital expenditure (partly due to the Whole Foods acquisition), which in the most recent year makes its free cash flow negative.</p>
<p>All these measures tell a different story about what’s going on in the two companies, stories we would have missed if we’d focused on revenue or net profit. Looking at all of the various measures, with a chief focus on free cash flow, makes it clear that the key question for both companies is one of asset intensity. If Netflix’s content acquisition costs continue to soar, it may never generate positive cash flows. Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods, an investment that expands its brick-and-mortar retail footprint, may significantly change its free cash flow profile.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Fixated on the Future</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">Accounting and financial analysis is preoccupied with characterizing the past and present. In contrast, finance professionals look to the future for the most important questions regarding the value implications of any decision. In short, the source of all value today is future performance as manifested in cash flows. That creates a problem for finance as not all future cash flows are created equal. Would you be indifferent to a dollar received today and a dollar received in ten years? Clearly, no. So finance prescribes thinking about the free cash flows an asset will generate in the future and figuring out what they are worth now.</p>
<p>That exercise is slightly more complicated than just adding up all those future cash flows. The reason is a fundamental idea in finance known as the time value of money. This core idea in finance is something really simple: $1 today is worth more than $1 a year from now.</p>
<p>Why? Well, if you have $1 today, you can do something with it and earn a return—which means that you’ll end up with more than $1 a year from now. That simple insight also means that $1 received a year from now must be worth less than $1 received today. But how much less?</p>
<p>That differential depends on the opportunity cost of that money. What opportunity for earning a return are you giving up? What could you have done with the money if you didn’t have to wait? Once you figure out the cost of waiting, you then “punish” that future cash flow by assessing a penalty that accounts for that opportunity cost. That’s called a discount rate. The idea of punishing cash flows may seem odd, but that’s literally what you’re doing in discounting—you’re punishing people who make you wait to receive your money because you don’t like to wait and because you could have done something with that money if they hadn’t made you wait.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_70" aria-label="70"></span>In later chapters, we’ll use these mechanics to do valuations of companies, but for now, let’s consider the underlying idea behind discounting and some of the basic formulas.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Discounting</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">How can we operationalize the idea of the time value of money and the notion of opportunity cost? One simple way is by using the notion of an interest rate. Let’s say that if you put money in the bank today, you’ll earn 10 percent, and then one year from now, you’ll end up with $1.10. Fundamentally, that makes you indifferent between $1 today and $1.10 a year from now. That’s the first clue why $1 today is worth more than $1 a year from now.</p>
<p>As a consequence, now you know how to punish future cash flows for making you wait to receive them. Every time you have to wait a year, you “haircut” future cash flows by one plus the interest rate, because that’s what you would have earned if you hadn’t had to wait.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Discounting Formula</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg70-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p class="TNI1">where</p>
<p class="EQ1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_55_Oblique_I_11">r</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_55_Roman_11">= discount rate</span></p>
<p>Here, <i>r</i> is the interest rate you could receive by making that relevant alternative investment—that’s the opportunity cost you charge for being asked to wait. For example, say you want to figure out how much $1,000 received one year from now is worth today. Assume that a bank offers you an interest rate of 5 percent, and that is the relevant alternative investment you would have made if you had that money now. You can use the method described to calculate that a $1,000 payment received one year in the future has a present value of $952.38 using that 5 percent. If you give the bank $952.38 today, it will give you $1,000 next year.</p>
<p>Suppose that the interest rate suddenly rises to 10 percent. Would the $1,000 a year from now still be worth $952.38? Or would it be worth more or less? What if interest rates fall instead?</p>
<p>If interest rates rise to 10 percent, you would need to deposit $909.09 in the bank, instead of $952.38, to receive $1,000 in a year. And if interest rates fell—let’s say to 2 percent—you would need to deposit only $980.39 to get $1,000 a year later. What does that imply? Well, you punish future cash flows much more in the 10 percent interest rate scenario (i.e., $1,000 a year from now is worth $909.09 today) because your opportunity cost is higher, and you punish future cash flows much less in the 2 percent scenario (i.e., $1,000 a year from now is worth $980.39 today).</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_71" aria-label="71"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Multiyear discounting</span></h3>
<p class="TNI1">What if you have cash flows over multiple years into the future? Consider the logic of punishment described earlier. If you don’t like to wait one year, you’re really not going to like waiting five years. How do you account for that? If you have to wait more than one year, you’ll have to discount those cash flows multiple times. Discounting over multiple years is similar to discounting over one year, except that the one-year discounting process has to be repeated. You can simply modify the original formula to handle more years:</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Discounting Formula for Multiple Years</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg71-1.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>Here, <i>r</i> is still the annual discount rate, or interest rate. To differentiate each year, I’ve introduced subscripts; the subscript next to the cash flow indicates the year that the cash will be received. For every additional year of waiting, you have to discount the flows more, because for each year of waiting, you have to charge more.</p>
<p>Suppose the bank is now offering a $1,000 payment for each of the next three years and the prevailing interest rate is still 5 percent. How much is that worth to you? First, you need to figure out the current values of each of the payments. If you have cash flows from multiple years that you want to add, you have to first convert all of them, using the equation, to today’s values. If you don’t do that, you are effectively comparing apples to oranges. Once you’ve made all the flows into apples, you can add them up.</p>
<p>When you add the three values together, you arrive at how much the bank’s offer is worth today:</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_72" aria-label="72"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Sunk Costs and Net Present Value</span></h2>
<p class="TNI1">One big lesson of the distinction between finance and accounting and the process of discounting is that sunk costs, which are costs that have already been incurred and can’t be recovered, don’t matter. While accounting carefully considers them in balance sheets and income statements, finance professionals view the amount paid for an asset as gone forever.</p>
<p>For example, say your company spent $100,000 on market research for a new product. Those amounts are gone, no matter what you find out about the product’s future. Accordingly, any decision about the future of the product (i.e., should we launch it?) should incorporate the feedback of the market research, but the $100,000 you spent is irrelevant. <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_73" aria-label="73"></span>That’s true not only of the cost of the research but also of the time spent on planning the creation and launch of the product. None of that will come back, no matter how much you want it to.</p>
<p>In short, assessing values requires you to: (1) look into the future, (2) think about what incremental cash flows will be generated over time, and (3) discount them back to the present using the notion of an opportunity cost of capital.</p>
<p>Working out the <i>present value</i> of a project involves adding up all the potential cash flows—positive and negative—after they’ve been discounted to today. (The cash you receive, or inflows, are positive numbers; the cash you spend, or outflows, are negative numbers.) Determining the <i>net present value</i> entails the same calculations, but it includes the initial cost of the project.</p>
<p>For example, assume Nike is building a new shoe factory at a cost of $75 million. The plant will produce $25 million in cash every year from the shoes Nike will be able to make and sell, for the next five years. Let’s use a 10 percent discount rate for this project.</p>
<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Nike Factory Present Value</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg73.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The present value of the project is $94.8 million. By paying $75 million for a project that is worth $94.8 million, Nike will generate $19.8 million in additional value—that’s the project’s net present value. Because of the $19.8 million increase in value, Nike should go ahead and build the factory. This is one of the key decision-making rules in finance—companies should undertake only projects with positive net present values.</p>
<p>The next year, Nike takes another look at production. Unfortunately, sales have not been good. Instead of making <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_74" aria-label="74"></span>$25 million in the first year, Nike has only made $10 million and expects this trend to continue for the next four years.</p>

<p class="RI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Many people argue that because central banks have kept interest rates low since the 2008 financial crisis, stock markets have risen quickly. Why would that be?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One interpretation of the recent bull market is that the fall in interest rates has led to an increase in the value of stocks because each future cash flow, either dividends or capital gains, is discounted less—leading to higher values of stocks.</span></p>
<p class="RD"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">In countries that are considered risky, investors often ask for high rates of return to compensate for those risks. What kind of investments might companies make in those environments, given the high discount rate they are forced to use?</span></p>
<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Investors may look for opportunities that provide returns over the short run in countries with high risk and high interest rates. That’s because cash flows far out into the future have very low values. So, for example, it’s harder to justify a large, costly aluminum smelter that takes years to build relative to a trading company that can be created quickly.</span></p>

<p class="EQ2"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_15">Nike Factory Present Value 2</span></p>
<figure class="EQ"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg74.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>The present value of the future cash flows of the Nike factory is now $31.7 million. What if a rival company approaches Nike and offers to buy the factory for $40 million after the first year’s disappointing results? Should Nike take the deal? Remember that Nike spent $75 million to build the factory.</p>
<p>Nike should take the deal without hesitation. The factory’s future cash flows are valued at only $31.7 million, so the $40 million offer is better. However, Nike will give up that sum in future cash flows in the process. The net present value of the offer—the value Nike will create for itself by taking the deal—is therefore $8.3 million. At this point, the $75 million paid to build the factory is a sunk cost—it’s irrelevant to the current decision. Hopefully, Nike’s rival has a plan to do better than Nike expects to do. Otherwise, it shouldn’t have offered $40 million for the factory.</p>
<p>This Nike example generalizes to two of the most important equations in finance. First, the present value of any in<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_75" aria-label="75"></span>vestment is the sum of all future cash flows discounted back to the present using an appropriate discount rate.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Equity Analysis for Corning Glass</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">If you were an equity analyst or an investor, how would you figure out whether to invest in a company? Let’s take a look at equity research analyst Alberto Moel’s analysis of Corning <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_76" aria-label="76"></span>Glass, which demonstrates the mechanics of valuation and the power of applying it correctly.</p>
<p class="TXB">Corning makes the glass for the displays on smartphones, televisions, and laptops. It is one of only a few companies that have mastered the manufacturing process for glass displays, which are extremely difficult to make. Because of this, the company has been able to dominate the market.</p>
<p class="TXB">Corning grew rapidly in the early 2000s as the demand for flat-screen televisions and smartphones skyrocketed. Eventually, demand began to slow. The markets for TVs and smartphones weren’t growing as fast, and therefore, growth in Corning’s end markets was tapering off. Eventually, despite its technology, scale, and market leadership, Corning began underperforming the stock market as margins for the glass display business (Corning’s customers) shrank.</p>
<p class="TXB">Look at the market performance of Corning from 2008 to 2012 compared with the S&amp;P 500, a measure of the market, and LG Display, one of Corning’s customers. (See <a href="#fig2-10">figure 2-10</a>.)</p>
<p class="TXB">The figure shows that, beginning in early 2010, as display margins at companies like LG Display began to shrink—panel prices had dropped 15 percent to 20 percent—the stock market began factoring those decreasing margins into the stock prices of their suppliers, including Corning.</p>

</figure>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Given all these factors, if you were Moel, would you buy or sell on Corning?</b></p>
<p class="iqa">On the one hand, it looks as if Corning’s customers are in trouble. LG’s margins, and the margins of all display makers, are compressing, which is limiting their cash flow. But what does that mean for Corning?</p>
<p class="TXB">In fact, glass prices—which impact Corning’s margins—hadn’t dropped in the same way that display prices had. That’s because Corning’s competitive edge has given it pricing <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_77" aria-label="77"></span>power. Since display makers are beholden to Corning, the company can maintain high prices, even when the cost of displays decreases. So Moel realized that the market had overextrapolated the effects of declining end-market demand for Corning by ignoring Corning’s pricing power.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Based on the discussion of Intel and Food Lion’s profit margins in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a> and Corning’s activities, do you think Corning has high or low profit margins?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Corning’s EBITDA margin was as high as 27 percent in 2012. Because Corning adds a great deal of value—it is essentially turning sand into glass—it should earn high margins.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Keeping Corning’s growth in mind, would you expect a large or small difference between its EBIT/revenue margin and its EBITDA/revenue margin?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Corning grew rapidly in the 2000s by investing heavily in manufacturing facilities, so it had a large amount of depreciation, which reduced its EBIT. That would have resulted in a large difference between its EBIT/revenue and EBITDA/revenue ratios, making the EBITDA margin a more reliable measure of its performance. In 2012, Corning’s EBIT/revenue margin was 14 percent compared to an EBITDA/revenue margin of 27 percent.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Forecasted Cash Flows</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">To start the process of valuing Corning Glass, the first thing Moel would do is to forecast cash flows. The next step is to take those forecasts and generate estimates of Corning’s free cash flows. (See <a href="#tab2-2">table 2-2</a>.) Can you calculate the free cash flows for 2014? Hint: Look at the 2012 and 2013 free cash flows to see how to do that.</p>
<p class="TXB">Using the free cash flow formula, we get: $2,195 <span class="itxt_in_symbol">+</span> $1,108 <span class="itxt_in_symbol">−</span> $1,491 <span class="itxt_in_symbol">−</span> $50 <span class="itxt_in_symbol">=</span> $1,762.</p>
<p class="TXB">Now, discount the free cash flows to figure out a present value by creating discount factors. Discount factors come from the discounting formula; they correspond to how much $1 years from now is worth today. Once you’ve done that—equity analyst Alberto Moel used a discount rate (<i>r</i>) of 6 percent—multiply the free cash flows by the discount factor. Do that for 2015; look at the 2014 number for help. (See <a href="#tab2-3">table 2-3</a>.)</p>
<p class="TXB">When you multiply the free cash flow by the discount factor, you get $1,381—the present value of the 2015 expected cash flow.</p>
<p class="TXB">To value Corning, add the discounted values of all future cash flows, which is $18,251. (<a href="#tab2-2">Tables 2-2</a> and <a href="#tab2-3">2-3</a> don’t include all the relevant cash flows for reasons that will become <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_78" aria-label="78"></span>apparent in <a href="../Text/chapter_5.xhtml">chapter 5</a>.) This represents the total value of the enterprise, but we want to know whether the stock is a good investment. To figure this out, we need to add the cash on the balance sheet (because, in addition to all the future cash flows, it belongs to the enterprise) and subtract the value of debt because shareholders get paid only after debt is retired. So Corning’s equity valuation is $21,152 or, given the 1,400 shares outstanding, $15.11 per share. The stock price at the time of Moel’s report was only $11, indicating that investors were overpenalizing Corning for the outcomes its customers were experiencing.</p>

<p class="TXB">Moel recommended “buy” in his report dated December 2012. Look at Corning’s performance over the next two years, compared to the S&amp;P 500 and LG Display. (See <a href="#fig2-11">figure 2-11</a>.)</p>
<p class="TXB">By understanding the source of Corning’s profit margins, Moel knew that its cash flows would hold better than the display makers, even as the end market became tighter. He knew that EBITDA was a more reliable measure than EBIT or net profit. By using discount rates and the time value of money, he determined the current present value of Corning shares and made an excellent recommendation. That’s what equity analysis, and investing more generally, is all about.</p>

<p class="noindent">Let’s look at Japan’s Sharp Corporation, which designs and manufactures electronic products such as TV sets, and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (known also as Foxconn Technology), the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer. As with the Corning case, we’re going to examine it over the next few chapters.</p>
<p class="TXB">The cornerstone of the case is Sharp’s Sakai LCD plant. Sharp was the first company to make and commercialize flat-panel displays, and it had to decide whether to build even <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_80" aria-label="80"></span>larger displays—think sixty-five-inch TVs—over time. LCD displays were once very small, and Sharp thought it could gain a competitive advantage through scale economies by making bigger displays. But this came with some manufacturing challenges, as large displays require massive sheets of glass, which require large factories.</p>

Now if you are a shareholder and the share appreciates and you can sell it, you get your cash back. If you’re a dividend investor, you will expect some cash back as a dividend. If you’re a debt investor, you expect an income stream from whatever cash is coming through. So being able to return cash to shareholders or to the claim holders of the company is the key.</span></p>
<p class="BSTX1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">You can look at all kinds of metrics so you can see how the company is growing. Does that generate cash? If it does, you’re good. If not, you’ve got a problem.</span></p>
<p class="BSTX1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Cash is very, very important, and looking at those cash metrics is the key. Ultimately, it all ties into the fundamentals of valuation. Ultimately, valuation is all about discounted cash flow. It is not discounted earnings flow. It’s cash flow. Because I put some cash in, I want it back with a return. That’s why discounted cash flow is everything.</span></p>

<p class="TXB">In 2011, Sharp estimated that it would require an investment of $4.8 billion, spread over three years, to build the world’s largest glass display factory in Sakai, near Osaka in Japan. Once the plant was commissioned in 2014, it would start generating cash for the company. Assuming a discount rate of 8 percent, let’s calculate the net present value to decide whether Sharp should build the plant. <a href="#tab2-4">Table 2-4</a> provides the spreadsheet of cash flows that allows you to determine the net present value (NPV) of the project by adding up all of the discounted free cash flows. (See <a href="#tab2-4">table 2-4</a>.)</p>
<p class="TXB">The net present value for the Sakai plant was <span class="itxt_in_symbol">−</span>$2,988.11 million. Should Sharp have built the plant? Everything we’ve just covered suggests that it should not.</p>
<p class="TXB">Despite the negative NPV, Sharp decided to build the plant because it was so enamored with both the technological challenge and the desire to be on the cutting edge. Sharp’s <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_81" aria-label="81"></span>management, like many management groups, distrusted NPV analysis when it didn’t provide the answer they wanted, and that distrust proved very problematic. Unsurprisingly, Sharp soon ran into problems. It had hoped, against its forecasts, that consumer demand for very large TVs would be robust. It had hoped it could sell the TVs for a few thousand dollars each, which would have allowed for enough margin, EBITDA, and cash flow to make the investment worthwhile. But consumers thought the price was too high.</p>

<p class="TXB">Sharp had no other choice but to lower the price, which shrank its profit stream. Its only hope, then, was to sell more televisions to make up the difference. But in order to attract enough customers, the company would have had to drop prices even more, which wasn’t economically feasible. Unfortunately, because of the dynamics at play, the factory became a stranded asset. The company wasn’t receiving a return on its investment, margins were compressing, and it was losing money. Shareholders were getting anxious as the stock price dropped and accounting considerations made the company anxious to divest the asset.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What is the minimum price Sharp should have accepted for the factory in 2011? To help you answer the question, consider the following:</b></p>
<ul class="iqbl">
<li class="iqbl"><b>Sharp spent $4.8 billion to build the plant.</b></li>
<li class="iqbl"><b>The project’s original NPV was −$2.9 billion.</b></li>
<li class="iqbl_last"><b>Sharp calculated that the current present value of the cash flows from the plant in 2011 was $3.2 billion.</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="iqa"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_82" aria-label="82"></span>Ultimately, Sharp was so desperate that it decided to sell 46 percent of the Sakai plant to Terry Gou, chairman of Hon Hai Precision, for $780 million. This transaction implied that the plant’s value was just $1.7 billion. Although Sharp was happy to get rid of the plant, the company sold it for much less than its true value of $3.2 billion at the time. In effect, Sharp made two poor decisions—it should never have built the plant because it had a negative NPV; it should have tried harder to sell it for much more than it did because Sharp transferred a large amount of value to Terry Gou.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Chapter Summary</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we explored two core finance principles. First, cash is a better measure of economic returns relative to profits. “Cash” is a somewhat ambiguous term, but it can be sharpened by thinking about EBITDA, operating cash flow, and free cash flow—finance nirvana. The emphasis on cash explains why companies that generate profits but no cash might be unsustainable and why companies that generate no profits but lots of cash might be valuable. Second, cash earned today is more valuable than cash earned tomorrow because of the opportunity cost of capital. Ignoring that opportunity cost can lead to value destruction or value transfers. All value comes from future cash flows, and making positive net present value decisions is the hallmark of a good steward of capital and manager. Everything else in the remainder of this book will build on those core ideas.</p>
