<p class="noindent"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_189" aria-label="189"></span>In 2013, Apple shareholders mounted a revolt against Tim Cook because they didn’t approve of Apple’s growing cash piles and wanted Cook to distribute the cash to shareholders. Why would it matter if the cash was on Apple’s balance sheet or in shareholders’ pockets? Since then, Apple has distributed more than $280 billion to shareholders, largely by buying back shares. Was that wise?</p>
<p>At the time of the revolt, Alphabet (aka Google) changed its shareholding structure to ensure that it would never face such a challenge by increasing the voting rights of key shareholders. Since then, Alphabet has generated mountains of cash but has distributed very little, choosing instead to reinvest the cash in its varied businesses. Was that wise?</p>
<p>In previous chapters, we saw how generating free cash flows is critical for thinking about how, and if, companies create value. But that leads to another question: Once a company is generating free cash flows, what should management do with that cash? Should managers invest that cash in new projects? Should they acquire companies? Or should they distribute the cash to their shareholders? In recent years, we’ve seen a large increase in share buybacks, sometimes called repurchases. Why are companies undertaking repurchases?</p>
<p>Every CEO and CFO must answer these central questions. Together, these questions determine the capital allocation process. With corporate profits and cash levels at historic highs, the question of how to allocate capital is increasingly <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_190" aria-label="190"></span>salient, and shareholders are less and less tolerant of mistakes. The capital allocation problem is another way of framing the problem we introduced in <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>: capital providers entrust managers with their capital and consider the fulfillment of the related obligation as a central indicator of how well management is doing their job.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">A Decision Tree for Capital Allocation</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">The capital allocation problem is best understood as a nested series of decisions, as seen in <a href="#fig6-1">figure 6-1</a>. The first question a manager has to address involves the availability of positive net present value (NPV) projects to spend money on. Creating value is central to a manager’s task, and that process involves beating the cost of capital, year over year, and growing, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>If positive NPV projects are available to you, then you should undertake them. Those projects may involve organic growth—say, introducing new products or buying new property, plant, and equipment—or inorganic growth via mergers and acquisitions. If there aren’t value-creating opportunities—that is, projects with positive NPVs—then a manager should distribute the cash to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. If you choose dividends, you’ll need to decide if you will create a regular dividend or issue a special one-time dividend.</p>

<p>While this decision tree in <a href="#fig6-1">figure 6-1</a> seems simple, there are innumerable hazards and fallacies that can trip up management as they choose what action to take. In this chapter, we’ll work through the entire decision tree and figure out how to make each trade-off and what mistakes to avoid.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The figure shows R&amp;D and cash distributions (dividends and stock repurchases) as a percentage of sales for Amgen, one of the largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">What does the figure tell you about how Amgen and the pharmaceutical industry are approaching capital allocation? Why do you think the approach is changing? The level of R&amp;D has stayed the same or decreased during this period, while distributions—previously not done at all—have become a major element of its capital allocation process. This suggests that Amgen simply can’t find enough investment opportunities given the cash flows it is generating. If Amgen is allocating capital well, shareholders are better off than if managers had invested in products or research that wouldn’t yield sufficient returns. If Amgen isn’t allocating capital well, it may be underinvesting in R&amp;D to satisfy impatient shareholders.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">If you’re in a position to make investments, there are some basic criteria to use to make that decision. First, you need to calculate the net present values of a number of options in order to identify the best value-creation opportunities. They could be organic or inorganic, and although the simple rule is to pursue the option with the highest net present values, there are a number of trade-offs to consider.</p>

<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Paul Clancy, former CFO of Biogen, commented:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">I define capital allocation as what to do with the excess cash flow generation of the company. If a company is spending a lot of money over a long time on R&amp;D, then that should be included in the definition as well. There are strategic deployments of capital, and then there is capital deployment in the form of returning cash to shareholders. Strategic deployment is investing in plants and in capital expenditures that don’t hit the P&amp;L in the near term but are designed to improve the business over a long time. Acquisitions certainly are a big piece of it for a company that has tremendous cash flow generation and R&amp;D. A majority of the annual R&amp;D expenditures are also capital allocation decisions. It’s deploying capital that otherwise could be freed up for shareholders.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_192" aria-label="192"></span>For example, as we learned in the previous chapter, there are many problems to consider when undergoing mergers and acquisitions, which can complicate present value assessments.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Perils of Inorganic Growth</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The lure of mergers and acquisitions as opposed to organic investment is often the apparent speed of buying existing assets instead of taking the time to build those assets. Moreover, the M&amp;A logic also implies that buying assets, as opposed to building them, is also safer, as the risk of completion has been resolved. While many people think mergers are faster and safer ways of achieving growth, there are many complications that companies must contend with before and after a transaction is completed.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Before the merger</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you buy preexisting assets, the seller has much more information about the asset than the buyer, and the buyer can only make educated guesses (as in the discussion in <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>). That’s why due diligence is such an important part of the M&amp;A process. Buyers need to understand the assets they’re acquiring. But, in the end, they have to remember that the seller has a large informational advantage.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_193" aria-label="193"></span>What might sellers do in approaching a sale? They might underinvest in assets to understate the capital intensity of the business. They might accelerate revenues and delay costs. And they might bury problems such as bankrupt customers who owe them by declaring those receivables still open. Intermediaries, like consultants and investment banks, can help buyers with these problems, and the buyer’s own deal teams can find out where the bodies are buried.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Hewlett-Packard’s Acquisition of Autonomy</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">On August 18, 2011, Hewlett-Packard, a computer hardware manufacturer, announced that it would purchase Autonomy, a search and data analysis company. HP paid $11.1 billion for the acquisition, corresponding to a 12.6 times EBITDA multiple. This price was considered quite rich; Oracle’s valuation of Autonomy determined that $6 billion would be the highest it would be willing to pay. Even HP’s CFO Cathie Lesjak had reportedly spoken out against the deal.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The market’s reaction to the announcement was harsh. HP’s stock fell from $29.51 to $23.60 on the day of the announcement (reflecting a $5 billion drop in market capitalization). Ray Lane, chairman of HP’s board, was asked about the discounted cash flow (DCF) model used to analyze the valuation and the underlying assumptions. In response, he claimed he was not familiar with the DCF model and instead emphasized HP’s strategic vision. Less than a month after the announcement, HP’s chief executive was removed.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One year later, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion (in other words, it reduced the goodwill asset on its balance sheet and recorded the loss as a onetime expense), including $5 billion in what HP claimed were “accounting irregularities” that it blamed on Autonomy’s management. HP claimed that Autonomy managers had inflated financial metrics in order to mislead potential buyers. By August 2012, HP’s market capitalization had fallen 43 percent from the time of the acquisition announcement.</span></p>
<p class="BTNIS"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">What mistakes did HP make in its Autonomy acquisition?</span></p>
<p class="BTTNIS1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">HP’s mistakes include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<ul class="bl-BBL">
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Poor due diligence</span></li>
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Insufficient investigation of accounting practices</span></li>
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Lack of adherence to traditional valuation models</span></li>
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Inadequate assessment of organic possibilities versus inorganic possibilities</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, everyone involved, from the seller to the intermediaries to the people within the buyer’s organization <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_194" aria-label="194"></span>who are on those deal teams, are incentivized to complete a transaction. If you’re not careful, it’s easy to be swayed by their enthusiasm and end up paying too much. So the notion that M&amp;A is safer than organic investment is far from well-grounded, and the data on the failure rates of mergers directly contradicts their supposed safety.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">After the merger</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although the rationale of synergies can be tantalizing when assessing a merger, <i>realizing</i> those synergies is no trivial task. At the time of a merger, it’s common to overestimate synergies, underestimate the time to realize them, and underestimate the onetime costs to realizing the synergies. Even worse, the acquirer can end up retaining two separate capacities for various functions for a long time, resulting in significantly higher costs than it had anticipated. The time it takes to realize the synergies can have a massive impact on the value creation of the merger.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most important, cultural issues in bringing two organizations together must be considered.While the difficulty of cultural integration is easy to ignore on a spreadsheet, the issues raised by cultural differences are paramount and have significant financial consequences. It’s all too easy to forget that those assumptions in the cells in spreadsheets are contingent on human actions, so ignoring them can be fatal. These issues also signal why the seeming speed and safety of mergers and acquisitions versus organic growth can be illusory.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Conglomerates</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Aggressive M&amp;A strategies can also lead to conglomerates, or multidivisional companies with broadly diversified holdings with little shared between the holdings. For example, in the 1960s, the ITT Corporation (a telecommunications company) attempted to purchase ABC Television until federal antitrust regulators halted the deal. Seeking to avoid antitrust laws and still expand, it purchased such dissimilar companies as Sheraton Hotels, Avis Rent a Car, and the bakery that makes Wonder Bread. Ultimately, ITT purchased over three hundred companies. Conglomerates, still popular in some parts of the world, are an opportunity to revisit some important finance intuitions.</p>
<p>There are two finance justifications for becoming a conglomerate. The first is a cost-of-capital argument. The thinking goes like this: “By doing the diversifying acquisition, I will bring my cost of capital to that target. For example, we have a 10 percent discount rate or cost of capital and look at that target company with a cost of capital closer to 15 percent. Well, if I can buy that company and put it inside my company, it will <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_195" aria-label="195"></span>get revalued higher because of my 10 percent cost of capital—and that can be powerful and value-creating.” This reasoning is flawed, as the correct cost of capital to use is a function of that business. You can’t export your cost of capital.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Merger of AOL and Time Warner</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">In late 2000, AOL and Time Warner announced one of the biggest mergers of the dot-com era—a deal valued at $350 billion. Before the merger, there were high expectations on how the two companies would fit together. At the time, AOL had a dominant dial-up internet business, and Time Warner owned content but didn’t understand the internet. The synergies seemed clear and easy to access. The deal was pitched as a “merger of equals,” but AOL was dominant at the time of the merger.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Shortly after the merger, trouble emerged. AOL’s culture was aggressive and sales-driven, while Time Warner was a more traditional company. Time Warner also discovered accounting irregularities at AOL that undercut its purported performance. As frictions increased, Time Warner began to push back on AOL initiatives and found other partners for distributing its content online. When the bloom came off the internet rose in early 2001, the balance of power shifted away from AOL and toward Time Warner.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The merger collapsed, and the combined value of both companies today is a fraction of what it was before the merger. In March 2009, Time Warner spun off Time Warner Cable, and in December 2009, AOL and Time Warner completely demerged. AOL was purchased by Verizon in 2015, and AT&amp;T reached a deal to buy Time Warner on October 22, 2016. AOL CEO Steve Case concluded, “ ‘Vision without execution is hallucination’ pretty much sums up AOL/TW.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter6_1" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter6-1">1</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p>The second finance rationale for diversifying is to manage risk. By owning different types of companies in different industries, shareholders are thought to benefit from diversification. The thinking equates acquisitions to stock portfolios: if one company goes south, then the other companies in your portfolio will prop it up. This line of inquiry, though, is faulty and ignores the fact that managers are undertaking diversification, while shareholders could arguably achieve that risk management themselves. The logic of finance is that you shouldn’t do something for your shareholders that they can do for themselves. And diversification at the corporate level is exactly that.</p>
<p>Indeed, conglomerates appear to destroy value rather than create it. Conglomerates often trade at a discount, which <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_196" aria-label="196"></span>means that their combined value is less than if the businesses were traded separately. Why would that be? In part, because capital allocation within a conglomerate is distorted by the pressure to treat all divisions equally. In the process, capital is distributed equally rather than allocated toward the best opportunities—weak divisions expand and promising divisions are starved. As a consequence, the divisions would be worth more apart than together.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">In late March 2008, Indian carmaker Tata Motors purchased Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) from Ford Motor Company, paying $2.3 billion for the acquisition (Ford had paid $5.4 billion for the two brands: $2.5 billion for Jaguar in 1989, and $2.9 billion for Land Rover in 2000). The market wasn’t impressed, and Tata Motor’s stock fell during 2008 as a result (from a market capitalization of $6.93 billion the day before the announcement to $1.72 billion at the end of the year, a 75 percent drop in a period when the broader market fell 33 percent).</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">After the merger, Tata chose not to integrate JLR. Instead, it let JLR operate as an independent company. Tata set targets and offered support in emerging markets but did not directly control JLR’s operations. As the figure shows, this strategy of avoiding a potentially difficult cultural integration appears to have paid off.</span></p>

<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Some analysts estimate that JLR now comprises 90 percent of Tata Motor’s total valuation. In hindsight, Tata’s decision not to integrate JLR worked out extremely well. But it’s worth considering the risks, which include duplicative overhead expenses as well as competition and confusion in product and labor markets, when a new acquisition operates largely independently.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Conglomerates aren’t always problematic. In some emerging markets, conglomerates can be powerful because they <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_197" aria-label="197"></span>overcome market imperfections in capital markets and labor markets by internalizing activity inside that conglomerate. But they aren’t a panacea, and managers in conglomerates must be vigilant about the possibility of “socializing” capital.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Distributing Cash to Shareholders</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Assuming a company doesn’t have worthwhile projects to pursue, it should distribute cash to shareholders. If a firm decides to distribute cash, how should it do so? There are two primary options—dividends and stock buybacks. The more intuitive way to distribute cash is to pay a dividend. A company simply pays cash to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. Dividends can be part of a predictable flow or they can be larger, one-off events—so-called special dividends.</p>
<p>The second method of cash distribution—a share buyback—is less intuitive. A company buys back its own shares in the open market and then retires them. As a consequence, investors who choose not to sell their shares will own a slightly larger fraction of the company, and cash has been distributed. Share buybacks have become tremendously popular over the last decade. (See <a href="#fig6-2">figure 6-2</a>.)</p>
<p>So which is the better method of distributing cash—dividends or share buybacks? There is no right answer to this question, but it is useful to begin by debunking some misconceptions so you can develop some better intuitions on this decision. For example, some argue that stock prices rise after buybacks because the remaining shareholders own more of the company afterward. Others argue that dividends are bad for shareholders because their shares will be worth less. To debunk these ideas and clarify the nature of the decision, we will begin by showing that whether a company chooses to distribute cash <i>shouldn’t matter</i>.</p>
<p>In terms of the raw mechanics, the choice between dividends and buybacks is irrelevant, but each method potentially sends a different signal to the market, and that can matter. First, let’s prove that it <i>shouldn’t matter</i> and that outcomes are equal. Let’s look at the market-based balance sheet in <a href="#fig6-3">figure 6-3</a>.</p>
<p>The company in the figure has a large amount of cash and is considering distributing some via a dividend or buyback. Because this balance sheet is market-based, the equity values can easily be translated to share prices and the value of operating assets are market values. If the company distributes $70 of that cash as a dividend to shareholders, what will happen to that market value balance sheet? Given that there are a hundred shares outstanding, that’s a $0.70 per share dividend. (See <a href="#fig6-4">figure 6-4</a>.)</p>
<p>The company’s cash holdings drop $70 from $100 to $30, but the value of the operating assets remains the same. <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_198" aria-label="198"></span>Because the debt remains the same, the equity value also has to drop $70 for the balance sheet to balance. The price per share would fall from $1.40 per share to $0.70 per share. As a shareholder, you might seem to be taking a hit. But when you factor in the $0.70 in cash you received, you’re left with $1.40. Shareholders are economically in the same position as they were before. It’s completely value-neutral. They could <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_199" aria-label="199"></span>return to where they began by buying one share with that $0.70 in cash, and they would be left with $1.40 in shares, just as before.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider if the company distributes $70 of its cash by buying back $70 worth of shares. (See <a href="#fig6-5">figure 6-5</a>.)</p>
<p>Again, its cash drops to $30, and the operating assets and debt remain the same. The equity value drops to $70. The $70 used to buy shares retires fifty shares, given the stock price of $1.40. What is the new stock price? Total equity value is $70, and there are now fifty shares outstanding; that provides a $1.40 share price. So how are shareholders feeling? The shareholders who sold to the company are left with $1.40 in cash, and the shareholders who stayed have a share worth $1.40. Nothing has changed—it’s value-neutral. (See <a href="#fig6-6">figure 6-6</a>.)</p>

<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_200" aria-label="200"></span>This exercise has an important core intuition. Value doesn’t arise from taking cash from one pocket and placing it in the other. Value arises from pursuing positive NPV projects. If neither keeping nor distributing cash results in changed value, then why is there all the fuss? Why are people so worried about whether companies are holding on to cash or distributing it? And why are they so worried whether they pay a dividend or not? And why have more and more firms started to buy back shares?</p>

<p class="noindent">The value neutrality of keeping or distributing cash is true under idealized conditions, the so-called Modigliani and Miller conditions of no taxes, perfect information, and no transaction costs. Under these conditions, there are no value consequences to the mechanics of dividends or buybacks.</p>
<p>Real-world considerations have an impact on these decisions, however. First, taxes can change the consequences for <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_201" aria-label="201"></span>value. For example, during a share buyback, investors have to sell their shares and incur a capital gain that may be taxed at a lower rate, while a dividend can be taxed at higher rates. Many people think that these tax consequences are one reason to prefer share buybacks over dividends.</p>
<p>The critical element in the real world is the asymmetric information and incentives discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>. How would you interpret a decision by Apple to undertake a share buyback? How would you react if it decided to pay a dividend?</p>
<p>If you think back to that asymmetric information problem, all actions are judged by the information they are thought to reveal. If the people with all the information about the company are buying back shares, they must think the firm is undervalued and are willing to put real money behind that sentiment. This decision is a very strong signal and helps explain why buybacks have become so popular and are often greeted with a price rise. Price reactions to share buybacks are driven by that signaling interpretation, not by the mechanics of dilution.</p>
<p>What about dividends? Dividend initiations can sometimes be met with the opposite reaction, even though dividends effectuate the same outcome as buybacks. Individuals with all the information about the company’s prospects are saying that they can’t find good investments and they don’t think the company is undervalued. In effect, they don’t have anything better to do with your money, so they’re giving it back to you. That’s not exactly the most positive signal.</p>
<p>It is possible to interpret dividend increases positively. Since dividends are fairly sticky (once a company starts paying dividends, it’s hard to stop), increasing dividends may mean the company has faith in the ongoing, increased profitability of the enterprise. Furthermore, if the company is going to maintain that dividend, it also binds management’s hands to some degree, which some investors think reduces the principal-agent problem discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, agency considerations are the other reason cash distribution decisions can have value consequences. Managers can use cash inside companies to pursue their own agendas, which may not coincide with shareholder interests. For example, as cash piles up, a CEO may be tempted by an acquisition that enhances their position in the CEO labor market but actually destroys value. So getting cash out of the corporation can have value consequences, not because of the mechanics of the distribution, but because it alleviates agency considerations.</p>
<p>Agency considerations can also provide a distinct interpretation of share buybacks. If the signaling argument were the whole story, we’d expect managers to time buybacks well and to be buying at low points in the market. As seen in <a href="#fig6-2">figure 6–2</a>, this doesn’t appear to be happening in the aggregate, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_202" aria-label="202"></span>as the last market peak was also the peak for buybacks. So clearly some firms are doing buybacks well and some are doing it poorly.</p>
<p>Adopting an agency perspective can help explain this phenomenon. Share buybacks can also be used to achieve various operating metrics. Let’s say a manager is a penny short on earnings per share (EPS) for a given quarter and knows that he’ll be punished by the market for the error, possibly making him miss out on a bonus. How can he “manufacture” a penny of EPS? A share buyback reduces the number of shares outstanding and increases EPS. But that short-run illusion of higher EPS is likely not in the best interests of shareholders.</p>
<p>In short, the mechanics of cash distributions often lead people to fallacious arguments about value consequences associated with dilution or share counts. The raw mechanics of buybacks and dividends are all value-neutral. The reason these decisions attract so much attention is because they provide information and address the principal-agent problem discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">The notion of value neutrality can help us understand a variety of financial transactions—equity issuances, stock splits, leveraged recapitalizations, and venture financing—and the illusions and mistakes they give rise to. This detour from capital allocation to financing transactions will help you cement many intuitions that we have developed.</p>

<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Laurence Debroux, CFO of Heineken, commented:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Some people believe that if you distribute dividends or do share buybacks, that means that you don’t have any good projects to invest in. It’s more of a balance. You can be a growth company and distribute a good dividend at the same time. Ten years ago, some institutional shareholders were not interested in dividends. They didn’t know what to do with it; it was complicated to collect. Some even sold the shares just before a dividend was distributed and bought back the shares afterward so they didn’t have to deal with it.</span></p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Equity issuance</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Many consider the value consequences of issuing equity problematic because of dilution. Specifically, equity issuance is thought to lead to stock price declines because investors end up with a smaller piece of the company.</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig6-7"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 6-7</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_203" aria-label="203"></span>Let’s return to the sample company and see how equity issuance works. Once again, we’re looking at a market-based balance sheet. (See <a href="#fig6-7">figure 6-7</a>.)</p>
<p>If the company decides to issue $70 more in equity, what will happen to its market-based balance sheet and the stock price? (See <a href="#fig6-8">figure 6-8</a>.)</p>
<p>After the company issues $70 in equity, it will have $70 more in cash for a total of $170; its operating assets and debt level are unchanged, so the market value of equity is now $210. How much are the shares worth? To think this through, we need to know how many shares are outstanding after the issuance. Shares are selling at $1.40 each, so raising $70 would require the company to issue 50 shares ($70 divided by $1.40). That leaves 150 shares outstanding to split the $210 in equity. Shares must therefore be selling for $1.40 per share ($210 divided by 150), just as before.</p>
<p>Issuing equity has not diminished the price of the company’s stock—it is exactly the same. In general, this is a manifestation of the lesson that value creation comes from the asset side of the balance sheet, not from financing. What about dilution? Shareholders may now have a smaller percentage share, but it is of a larger pie.</p>

<p>Even so, when companies issue stock, the stock price often does decline. Why do you think this happens? In <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>, we saw the nature of the information problem in capital markets. When companies are issuing shares, they are sellers of <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_204" aria-label="204"></span>shares. This inevitably leads to questions about why they are choosing to raise funds by selling shares as opposed to using debt or internally generated profits. In short, equity issuance sends a negative signal.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Stock splits</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A similar confusion can arise about stock splits. Let’s say the company decides to split its stock two-for-one. In other words, for every share of stock that an investor currently holds, they will now hold two shares. This can also be termed a stock dividend—every holder of a share will receive one share. What will happen to the company’s market-based balance sheet, and what will happen to the value of its shares? (See <a href="#fig6-9">figure 6-9</a>.)</p>
<figure class="table">

</figure>
<p>There are no changes to the market-based balance sheet because there have been no changes in operations or to financing sources. What is each share worth? There’s still $140 worth of equity, but now it’s now split over 200 shares, so each share is worth $0.70 ($140 divided by 200). Investors haven’t lost value. Each investor used to have one share worth $1.40. Now they have two shares worth $0.70 each, for a total of $1.40. No value has been created or destroyed by this stock split.</p>
<p>Some companies split their stock in order to make their stock price more enticing to smaller investors, but Warren Buffett has refused to ever split his stock. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently has A Class shares that trade at over $215,000 per share. His reasoning is that stock splits are meaningless and only encourage short-term interest in a stock through a seemingly cheaper price. In 1983, Buffett asked, “Could we really improve our shareholder group by trading some of present clear-thinking members for impressionable new ones who, preferring paper to value, feel wealthier with ten $10 bills than with one $100 bill?”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter6_2" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter6-2">2</a></sup> (In 1996, Buffett did introduce B Class shares that sold for one-thirtieth the price of <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_205" aria-label="205"></span>the A shares in order to allow more investors to buy his shares. These B shares have since undertaken stock splits.)</p>
<p>These kinds of actions can remove frictions in some circumstances. In 2011, Citigroup performed a reverse stock split: for every ten shares of stock held, investors received one share. Citigroup did this because its stock price had fallen to $4, and many institutional investors have guidelines that prevent them from purchasing stocks for less than $5. By performing the reverse stock split, Citigroup raised its price to $40 and was able to access an important group of investors for its shares. Stock splits do not create value <i>per se</i> but can have value consequences because of market imperfections, just as with stock issuance.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Leveraged recapitalization</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">A leveraged recapitalization sounds like a complicated and scary transaction, but it’s just a combination of transactions we’ve already seen. In effect, it is a large dividend funded by the issuance of debt. Imagine that the private equity fund that owns a company wants to do a leveraged recapitalization. The company will borrow an additional $60 and combine it with $40 of its cash to pay out a special $100 cash dividend to its shareholders. What will happen to the market-based balance sheet, and what will the shares be worth? (See <a href="#fig6-10">figure 6-10</a>.)</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig6-10"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 6-10</span></p>
<p class="FIGT"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">Post-recapitalization, market-based balance sheet</span></p>

</figure>
<p>First, debt will increase by $60, and cash will increase by $60 to $160. Then, cash will decrease by $100, because it is used to pay a dividend. Adding up the market value of the operating assets and remaining cash and subtracting debt, we’re left with $40 of equity value. What does this mean for the shareholders? One hundred shares are now worth $0.40 per share ($40 divided by 100 shares), but shareholders have also received a dividend of $100, split up across those shares—or $1 each ($100 divided by one hundred shares). That adds up to the same $1.40 per share the fund had before.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_206" aria-label="206"></span>The mechanics of this transaction don’t necessarily yield value consequences, but there can be value consequences because of other factors. Specifically, the equity is now substantially riskier, and that should be associated with higher expected returns (as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>) and lower values.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Venture financing</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">As companies grow and require more funding, their founders find investors—called angel investors—to provide funding. This process often happens more than once, and the different rounds of funding are called Series A, Series B, and so on, and can also feature professional venture capital firms.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a brand-new enterprise. Before the first round of external financing, its balance sheet is a little ambiguous. The founders own the equity, and the founders’ ideas are the assets of the company. The founders have allocated a hundred shares of company stock to themselves, but the company is still entirely private.</p>
<p>The company needs an additional $100 to invest in a positive NPV project and goes to a venture capitalist for that funding. The venture capitalist says, “I’ll give you the $100 in funding you’re requesting, but I want to own 20 percent of the company in return.” By making that offer, the venture capitalist has implicitly valued the company.</p>
<p>If 20 percent of the company’s equity is worth $100, then 100 percent of the company’s equity must be worth $500. And if balance sheets have to balance, then $500 is the value of all the assets as well. Since the company will have $100 in cash immediately after the financing, this means the remaining asset—the business the founders have built so far—is worth $400. The $500 on the equity side is split between the founders (80 percent) and the venture capitalists (20 percent), so the founders’ stake is worth $400 ($500 multiplied by 80 percent), and the venture capitalists’ stake is worth $100 ($500 multiplied by 20 percent). Finally, 25 shares are issued to the venture capitalists to represent their share of the equity, for a total of 125 shares (the founders currently have 100 shares, and 100 shares are 80 percent of 125; likewise, 25 shares are 20 percent of 125). The value of each share is $4 ($500 of equity divided by 125 shares). This round of funding implicitly values the business before the funding (this is sometimes called the pre-money value) and by valuing the business after the funding (the post-money value). (See <a href="#fig6-11">figure 6-11</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, let’s imagine that the company returns a few years later for a second round of financing (the B Series). The company doesn’t have any more cash on hand (its cash bal<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_207" aria-label="207"></span>ance is $0), and it’s asking for $1,000 in investment. The Series B investors ask for 50 percent of the company in return for the $1,000 investment. What does the balance sheet look like after this round of financing, and what are the founders’ shares now worth?</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig6-11"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 6-11</span></p>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="../Images/Figure_06-11.svg"><img src="../Images/Figure_06-11.jpg" alt="" width="1017" height="294"/></object>
</figure>
<p>The Series B investors are offering $1,000 for 50 percent of the company. After the investment, there will be $1,000 in cash and the existing business. If the $1,000 represents 50 percent of the company, then all of the equity is worth $2,000. This implies that the enterprise is now worth $1,000 ($2,000 total asset value <span class="symbol">−</span> $1,000 cash).</p>
<p>The founders have 100 shares and the Series A investors have 25 shares. These 125 shares are worth $1,000, or $8 per share ($1,000 divided by 125). That means the value of the founders’ shares is now $800 ($8 times 100), and the value of the Series A investors’ shares is now $200 ($8 times 25). Finally, 125 shares are issued to the Series B investors to represent their 50 percent ownership that is worth $1,000. (See <a href="#fig6-12">figure 6-12</a>.)</p>
<p>Have the founders seen their equity diluted? The founders have gone from owning 100 percent of the company and holding stock worth an unknown amount, to owning 80 percent of the company (after the first round of financing) and holding stock worth $4 per share ($400), to owning 40 percent of the company (after the second round of financing) and holding stock worth $8 per share ($800). With each round of financing, their equity is diluted, but their stakes grow in value because the pie is growing larger as well.</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig6-12"></a>
<p class="FIGN"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">FIGURE 6-12</span></p>

</figure>
<p>The process of share issuance is particularly fraught in the case of new ventures because those financings actually involve telling a founder what they are worth. But the mechanics of equity financings do not give rise to value consequences. Sim<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_208" aria-label="208"></span>ilarly, distributions per se don’t change value, but distributions that change the riskiness of shares, like leveraged recapitalization, can have an impact on value because they change risk, expected returns, and prices, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">What if corporations neither distribute nor invest? What if they just hoard cash? Over the last ten years, that situation has become more common and has exasperated many. Why hold on to cash? There are several possible reasons to hoard cash. First and foremost, there have been significant tax penalties to US companies for paying out cash if that cash is held abroad (these penalties were lessened by Congress at the end of 2017). Second, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>, cash balances can serve as insurance against rocky times.

<p class="noindent">Given the importance of capital allocation, it’s useful to emphasize the precise places where things can go wrong. These are six of the biggest mistakes that happen during the capital allocation process.</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BL"><b>Delaying decision making.</b> Not making capital allocation decisions results in rising cash levels on corporate balance sheets. These rising cash levels typically frustrate shareholders as they question why managers are unable to deploy capital. Moreover, cash on balance sheets can attract the attention of activist investors who can use that cash as financing to take that company private.</li>
<li class="BL"><b>Trying to create value through share buybacks.</b> Managers sometimes justify buybacks by claiming that they create value for shareholders by buying shares cheaply. In fact, value can’t be created through share buybacks. At best, share buybacks transfer value across shareholders, depending on the buyback prices for shares. Managers can only create value by investing in positive NPV projects.</li>
<li class="BL"><b>Preferring acquisitions over organic investment because acquisitions are faster and safer.</b> Acquisitions appear to be faster and safer but can actually prove to be the opposite. Because of the informational problems between sellers and buyers, it can be risky to acquire companies, and the integration issues associated with acquisitions can offset any purported gains.</li>
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_209" aria-label="209"></span><b>Preferring buybacks over dividends because buybacks are discretionary while dividends are not.</b> In fact, shareholders can become just as accustomed to a steady stream of buybacks as they do with dividends. Moreover, shareholders value a company’s commitment to pay dividends, which can result in gains to shareholders. Finally, special dividends are a simple way to distribute cash that explicitly will not generate expectations for future dividends.</li>
<li class="BL"><b>Preferring to reinvest cash to build a larger business.</b> Size, rather than value creation, can quickly become <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_210" aria-label="210"></span>an objective of managers as it’s more fun to run a larger business. Building empires can become a major objective for managers that can contradict their mandate to be good stewards of capitals.</li>
<li class="BL"><b>Excessive distribution of cash to satisfy short-term shareholders.</b> Overlooking positive NPV projects is as problematic as pursuing size over value creation. Short-term earnings goals and pressure from shareholders who care only about these short-term earnings metrics can cause a manager to overlook good investments.</li>

<p class="noindent">In January 2015, Biogen announced the acquisition of Convergence Pharmaceuticals, a company working on developing drug therapies for neuropathic pain. Convergence was a small biotech company based in Cambridge, England. GlaxoSmithKline, a major player in the pharmaceutical industry, had deprioritized its therapies for pain management, spun off Convergence, and gave it some seed funding to continue its research. At the same time, Biogen began to prioritize therapies and drugs for nerve pain, and was looking for acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>At a conference, one of Biogen’s scientists learned about Convergence and its therapy for trigeminal neuralgia, a debilitating form of facial pain. At the time, Convergence was showing what is referred to as Phase II data—essentially, the company was close to achieving proof of concept.</p>
<p>For a small acquisition like this, Biogen started by examining the science, assessing the probability of the therapy going to market, and researching whether or not the therapy is protected by a patent. From there, the finance people got involved. Working with sales and marketing, they began to form the basis for a NPV model that took into account development costs. Then they looked at a range of outcomes and decided whether this was an attractive acquisition.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>How would you incorporate the technological risk of a new pharmaceutical product into the valuation of an acquisition? How would the potential existence of synergies affect your opening and final bids?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">You should model the technological risk by building various scenarios when developing your valuation. Based on the likelihood of these scenarios (e.g., anything from the technology being worthless to it taking off), you can create a weighted average of those scenarios to generate your final expected value for the acquisition.</p>
<p>You also want to think about the stand-alone value and the value you will be providing to that company. When bidding, the expected value, including the value-added, should be your final ultimate bid, while you may base your opening bid on the valuation from a stand-alone perspective.</p>
<p>Convergence is what Biogen’s CFO Paul Clancy calls a one molecule product—that is, one therapy for one disease. Since the usage for the product is narrow, the risk is high. So Biogen sought to mitigate some of that risk. Because <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_212" aria-label="212"></span>Convergence was a small company that needed more funding, Biogen offered it cash up front to cover its funding costs and then a percentage of future profits. This way, both Biogen and Convergence had skin in the game.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>With a contingent value right (CVR) instrument, the payoff to the seller is the function of a future event, such as drug performance or the performance of an acquisition. How does a CVR reallocate risks in the Biogen-Convergence deal and why would Clancy want to use one?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">By using a CVR, Biogen has shifted some risk to the seller, relative to an outright acquisition. This transfer makes sense for several reasons. When faced with taking a CVR, only confident sellers would be willing to accept it, so it selects against those with weaker prospects. Additionally, Biogen has ensured it hasn’t overpaid if the technology fails. Finally, the CVR gives the seller an incentive to work hard to ensure the success of the drug. The CVR addresses the deep asymmetric information problem in this setting—Convergence knows the value of the molecule that it’s selling better than Biogen ever could.</p>
<p>After the acquisition was complete, Biogen began the integration phase. The question was: Should Convergence remain in England or be brought to the United States? At first, Biogen decided to keep Convergence where it was. If it turned out to be a marketable project, Biogen would reconsider. By keeping the Convergence team in England, Biogen thought that it could preserve the team’s entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What would some of the challenges be if Biogen decided to fully integrate Convergence?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">There are many challenges:</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BL">The scientists who developed the treatment may not want to move to Boston, which could result in losing knowledge of how to continue development.</li>
<li class="BL">Cultural clashes may impede integration if the team from Convergence is no longer fully stand-alone.</li>
<li class="BLL">Convergence’s team members had incentives to work as a team and succeed. By integrating them fully, this team dynamic might be lost.</li>
</ul>
<p class="TB-TNI">Ultimately, Biogen kept Convergence separate for two years before moving drug R&amp;D and production to its other facilities, at which point it closed the original Convergence facility.</p>

<p class="noindent">Like Biogen, Heineken is a large company that often expands through acquisitions, especially when it’s trying to move into <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_213" aria-label="213"></span>a new country. In 2012, Heineken purchased two companies in Ethiopia as part of its expansion into Africa. Heineken thought that Ethiopia, with its fast-developing economy, young population, and relatively low beer consumption, was worth investing in.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>In addition to all of the normal concerns when acquiring a company, what are the financial concerns of acquiring a company in another country?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">There are several potential risks, including:</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BLT">The risk of being exposed to a foreign currency. Since revenue is denominated in the currency of the other country, changes in the value of its currency could have an impact on total cash flows once those flows are converted to the home currency.</li>
<li class="BL">The risks associated with trade agreements or taxation.</li>
<li class="BL">The risks that revenue projections will be lower than expected because of differing cultural tastes.</li>
<li class="BLL">The political risk of the country—a possibility that a future government could seize state-owned breweries.</li>
</ul>
<p class="TB-TNI">Whenever a company has operations in a new country, logistics can be particularly problematic. Large companies like Heineken have specialists in logistics and negotiations who can deliver the best cost estimates. But logistics costs can wreak havoc on financial forecasts. For example, there are discharge costs to remove goods from ships; if you’re unable to load the goods onto trucks in a timely manner, suppliers will charge a fee for every day you’re late. These extra costs can skew forecasts.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>In an emerging market like Africa, there are often surprise costs, such as logistics costs. How might you incorporate them into your initial NPV for the acquisition?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">As with the risk of bringing a new drug to market, you can use scenarios to analyze the likelihood of pessimistic outcomes. To do those scenarios correctly, you need to research the company and country you are thinking of investing in. The weighted average of those scenarios, with their associated probabilities, is the best valuation you can arrive at amid this kind of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What challenges do you think a foreign acquisition creates for integration?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">The chance of cultural differences can be higher, in the work practices of not only the business but also the country. Synergies may be harder to realize than expected. For example, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_214" aria-label="214"></span>you can’t integrate an IT call center if there is a language barrier. Additionally, there are the hazards of integrating a company thousands of miles away. Local management may not have an incentive to work with you and may resist your changes. Incorporating all of these potential issues into a scenario analysis is critical to making the right decision.</p>

It is actually better for someone to know that their boss has not been appointed as a future boss of the organization than to be in the middle of nowhere and not know what’s going to happen to the organization. They can then make a clear choice—“Do I stay, do I leave? If I stay, am I motivated enough?

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Biogen’s Share Repurchases</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Leading up to 2015, Biogen had achieved top-line growth of between 20 percent and 40 percent. Driven by the success of Tecfidera, a treatment for multiple sclerosis, Biogen had nearly doubled its business. Since the company was building up cash, and its financial outlook was robust, investors were especially keen to understand what the company planned to do with its excess cash.</p>
<p>In 2015, CFO Paul Clancy met with the board and got approval for a $5 billion share-repurchase program, which the company planned to implement over many years. When the board approved the program, the company’s stock price was high, hovering between the mid- and high $300s, so the company decided to wait to implement the program.</p>
<p>A few months later, as Tecfidera’s growth began to moderate, its stock price dropped into the mid-$200s. In Clancy’s calculations, the market was wrong and was undervaluing the company by about 20 percent. The company had also been, according to Clancy, “working on [its] pipeline pretty intently through tuck-in acquisitions and a number of organic programs that <span class="ellipsis">…</span> could come to fruition over the next couple of years.”</p>
<p class="STNIS"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_215" aria-label="215"></span><b>What advantages and disadvantages does Clancy have over analysts and investors in Biogen when he performs a valuation of his own company?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">Unlike outside analysts, Clancy likely knows much more about the future prospects of the company and its drugs. The disadvantage is that he may not have an outside perspective and his views may be colored by being an insider. Given the stock price drop, Clancy and his team at Biogen decided to go ahead and expedite its share-repurchase program.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What are the advantages to undertaking share buybacks over a short time? (Hint: think about signaling.)</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">The benefits are that a company would send a strong signal that it believes that its stock price is undervalued. Performing share repurchases regularly suggests a policy of repurchasing, while buying back many shares at once signals a belief in the undervaluation of stock. <a href="#fig6-13">Figure 6-13</a> shows Biogen’s share buyback program, including the amounts and the company’s stock performance since January 2015. Until July 2017, Biogen stock hovered just below $300 per share before jumping to around $350 with the announcement of a new Alzheimer’s disease therapy.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">A Shareholder Revolt against Apple</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Activist investors are increasingly pressuring managers to justify their capital allocation decisions. In 2012, just as Apple was succeeding in the product markets, shareholders revolted. At the time, Apple had amassed more than $130 billion in cash. The market value of Apple’s stock was $560 billion, which meant that the company was valued at $430 billion (its market value minus its excess cash). Investors, led by David Einhorn and Carl Icahn, decided to revolt.</p>
<p>In Einhorn and Icahn’s view, Apple was acting like a bank, and its cash was stockpiled at zero percent interest. They called upon Apple to distribute some of its cash. Apple resisted these calls on two grounds. First, the world economy wasn’t stable, so the stockpiled cash could be necessary at a future date to ward off trouble. Second, it could use the cash for future investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Apple’s explanations were fine in theory. The problem was that the amount of cash far exceeded plausible values associated with those explanations. If the business fell apart, for example, it could continue for many years with much less cash. The same goes for its investments. Even if Apple wanted to acquire a company—which had never been a part of its growth history—$130 billion was enough to buy Hewlett-Packard three times over. In fact, its most recent acquisition at the time was Beats, for just $3 billion.</p>
<p>There was another big reason Apple was resistant to dividends and buybacks. Since most of its cash was in Ireland, bringing back the cash to the United States might trigger tax consequences that Apple didn’t want. To get around the issue, Einhorn proposed what he called an iPref. Einhorn noted that Apple was currently trading at $450 per share and was producing $45 in EPS for a P/E multiple of 10X. Einhorn proposed to take $10 of the $45 in EPS and give it to the shareholders in the form of iPref dividends. More specifically, each shareholder would receive five iPrefs for each common share owned, and each of those iPrefs would receive $2 in dividends per year. Effectively, Einhorn was dividing the $45 of EPS into $35 of earnings associated with their common shares and $10 of earnings associated with their iPref shares.</p>
<p>Why go to this trouble? According to Einhorn, this move would unlock large amounts of value. The new common <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_217" aria-label="217"></span>shares would be valued at the same P/E ratio of 10X, as the original common shares were, and would be worth $350. And the new iPref would be valued as a very safe bond because of the cash in Ireland, so investors would be happy with a 4 percent return. The willingness to live with a 4 percent return implies that the five iPrefs would collectively be valued at $250 ($250 <span class="itxt_symbol">×</span> 4% <span class="itxt_symbol">=</span> $10 dividends). That is, the iPref would be valued at a multiple of 25X, or a 4 percent return. So a share previously worth $450 would be split, and the combined value would rise to $600 ($250 <span class="itxt_symbol">+</span> $350).</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>How could Einhorn create $150 per share by this financial engineering? What’s wrong with this plan? What happened to the idea of value neutrality?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">Einhorn was suggesting that by splitting $45 of earnings into $35 for the common shares and $10 for the iPref, value would jump. How did he accomplish that? The key is thinking he could safely assume those multiples of 25X for the iPref and 10X for the new common shares.</p>
<p>Which of those two assumptions—25X for the iPref or 10X for the common—is suspect? Initially, the 25X assumption might seem suspect, but that’s reasonable given how low yields were on regular bonds and how safe the iPref would be. The suspect assumption is keeping the P/E multiple on the common stock the same as it was before, at 10X. That’s effectively saying the $45 earnings stream on the old common shares should be valued the same as the $35 earning stream on the new common shares.</p>
<p>But are those two earning streams the same? Because of the iPref in Apple’s capital structure, the new common stock is quite a bit riskier. In effect, Einhorn is saying you don’t care about risk. You’ll pay the same amount for the common stock before, 10X, as you will after there’s an additional claim ahead of it. That’s effectively saying you won’t charge any additional return for bearing that additional risk. That is likely a dubious assumption. The common stock would trade at a lower earnings multiple because of the higher expected return associated with bearing more risk (see <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml#fig4-11">figure 4-11</a>).</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Imagine that you are Apple. Einhorn has created a revolt over the iPrefs, and your shareholders are demanding that you do something. Do you agree to the iPref idea, even though you know it won’t do what Einhorn is promising? Do you try to point out to your shareholders that his math is dubious? Do you give a dividend? Buy back shares?</b></p>
<p class="TB-TNI">Even though Einhorn’s logic was a little dubious, Apple effectively buckled and launched one of the largest share buyback programs ever and increased its dividend severalfold over time. It committed to distributing over $100 billion by the end of 2015. At the same time, Apple agreed to distribute <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_218" aria-label="218"></span>cash, it borrowed about $20 billion. Why borrow money when you’re sitting on large sums of cash? One reason is it wanted to avoid taxes on the cash it was bringing back from Ireland. That pattern continues. In 2018, Apple had around $115 billion of debt, had distributed $290 billion largely through buybacks, and held around $280 billion of cash. It funded much of its returns to shareholders by borrowing.</p>
<p>Over time, and particularly at the announcements of these distributions of cash, Apple stock rose quite a bit and ultimately split. Einhorn’s logic was wrong, and he likely knew it. But he succeeded in shining a light on the problem of cash at Apple. And Apple management effectively said, “Fine, we’ll distribute these cash flows and go down the distribution branch of the capital allocation tree.”</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Chapter Summary</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Capital allocation is increasingly a manager’s central preoccupation. The value creation and destruction possible from poor allocation decisions—for example, ill-conceived mergers and ill-timed buybacks—can dwarf the possibilities of other managerial decisions. The opportunities and pitfalls of the capital allocation decision tree are summarized in <a href="#fig6-14">figure 6-14</a>.</p>
<p>The central impetus should be, as always, to pursue value-creation opportunities, and buying back shares cheaply is not value creation but simply value redistribution. If you have those opportunities to create value, the critical decision is whether to pursue them organically or inorganically. This fork in the road is a particular minefield—typical logics such as “M&amp;A is faster” and “think of the synergies!”—often get things completely wrong.</p>
<p>The other fork in the road for how to distribute cash is similarly fraught with mistakes. A key lesson is that cash within and outside the corporation should be worth the same—value is created on the asset side of the balance sheet, not through financing decisions. These decisions really matter only in the context of market imperfections, such as taxes and information asymmetries. Within this fork, thinking through the signaling, agency costs, and tax consequences of these decisions is critical. Varying distribution strategies and using special dividends is particularly powerful.<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_221" aria-label="221"></span></p>
