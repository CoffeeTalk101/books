<p class="noindent"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_87" aria-label="87"></span>In the summer of 2018, Netflix, the online video streaming service, announced that it had added 670,000 new domestic subscribers to its service and 4.5 million international subscribers (in addition to the 125 million subscribers it already had). The stock fell by 14 percent in after-hours trading. Why? How could a large increase in the total subscriber numbers translate to a 14 percent stock price drop?</p>
<p>In 2014, activist investor Nelson Peltz took a large stake in PepsiCo and began demanding that it split its snack foods division (Frito-Lay) from its soft-drink division. PepsiCo responded by saying, “We trust that you appreciate the seriousness with which we have examined your observations and proposal and the firmness with which we reject the proposal to separate the businesses.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter3_1" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter3-1">1</a></sup> Peltz then took his complaint to other shareholders, leading to a lengthy shareholder revolt that ended two years later when Peltz sold his stake in the company. Why would an activist shareholder fight with a company’s upper management?</p>
<p>In our retirement accounts, we face choices between different kinds of funds, including active and passive mutual funds? What does that mean? What are mutual funds and how are they different from those evil hedge funds?</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll come to understand the who, why, and how of capital markets. These markets are critical for the growth of the economy and increasingly guide policymakers and managers. But, these markets have also engendered great skepticism about their value and wisdom. Regardless of your views on these markets, you will interact with them <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_88" aria-label="88"></span>more and more as a rising manager, a saver, and a citizen. Here, we’ll explore and demystify capital markets.</p>
<p>Most broadly, we’re going to ask what role finance plays in society and how to restructure that role. In the process, we’ll confront the prevailing skepticism on the value of financial markets and discover that finance is about much more than money.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Why Can’t Finance Be Simple?</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Why can’t the world of finance be simpler? Let’s think about a simple version of capital markets. On one side, there would be individuals and households that have savings that they want to invest. These are people like you and me who want to save for college or retirement and want to use that money to generate a return. On the other side are companies that need capital to build new projects and grow. So a simpler financial world would just have the savers and firms, and we wouldn’t need the mess of finance that exists in the middle. (See <a href="#fig3-1">figure 3-1</a>.)</p>
<p>So why doesn’t the world work this simply? Why can’t individuals just give their money directly to companies and be done with it? In fact, the world of finance looks considerably more complex. (See <a href="#fig3-2">figure 3-2</a>.)</p>

</figure>
<p>Why are capital markets so complex? Why do we have so many intermediaries, such as investment banks, funds, and analysts who stand between savers and firms? When most people look at the mess of capital markets, they conclude that it is a rigged system filled with leeches that extract value from all the real people in the economy. Indeed, in the wake of the financial crisis, this view prevails more and more. As we explore this terrain, we’ll try to figure out why the financial world is as complex as it is and whether it really needs to be.</p>

<p class="noindent">To examine all this complexity, let’s use the person at the center of it all—the equity research analyst—as a guide. The analyst’s job is to value companies by creating forecasts and then make recommendations to investors. Alberto Moel, the equity analyst who examined Corning Glass in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, did exactly this. Analysts spend most of their days, and sometimes nights, talking to people. Mapping Moel’s conversations can help us begin to understand this world.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Companies</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">First and foremost, Moel wants to talk to the companies he’s evaluating (such as Corning), and within those companies, he’ll talk to anyone he’s allowed to. At a minimum, he’ll have conversations with CEOs and CFOs (like Laurence Debroux of Heineken and Paul Clancy of Biogen), whom he’ll ask about new product launches, strategy, and forecasts. Basically, Moel looks for information, beyond the raw numbers, that will tell him how a company is performing, which is a critical ingredient for formulating forecasts that will guide his recommendations.</p>
<p>Since finance is always a two-way street, CFOs such as Debroux and Clancy will have their own questions and want to pick Moel’s brains, which can be a valuable source of industry knowledge and provide a better understanding of the competitive landscape. This exchange of information is one of the first key insights about capital markets—often, their interactions take the form of trades, and these trades may not only be in capital. Often, these trades are for information or knowledge.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Institutional Investors: The Buy Side</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Moel shares his analysis of the companies he covers with a broad array of investors. These are not just any investors but rather they are institutional investors, including people like Jeremy Mindich of Scopia Capital. People in finance use a lot of different labels for institutional investors—money managers or asset managers—or, more generally, they might refer to them as the buy side. But, despite the different nomenclature, institutional investors are simply entities that invest large amounts of capital on behalf of others and allocate it in ways that they feel will best support their clients. There are several different kinds of funds, including mutual funds, pension funds, foundations and endowment funds, sovereign wealth funds, and hedge funds.</p>
<p>The rise of institutional investors has been one of the most important developments in modern capitalism, so let’s take a <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_91" aria-label="91"></span>closer look at specific types of institutional investors so they won’t seem so foreign when you encounter them. We’ll discover some of the biggest ideas in finance as we trace through Moel’s interactions with these investors.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Mutual funds.</span> Mutual funds manage money on behalf of individuals and invest those funds in diversified portfolios of stocks or bonds. To give you a sense of their enormity, Fidelity and Black Rock collectively manage nearly $10 trillion through various mutual funds. There’s a good chance you’re invested in mutual funds through your retirement accounts. Because mutual funds invest on behalf of individuals with varying amounts of wealth and sophistication, they are tightly regulated.</h4>
<p>Given their exposure to risky assets like stocks, they need to manage those risks. Their method for managing risks is an example of a fundamental lesson of finance. They hold a wide selection of stocks, rather than a few, so that the funds are not overly exposed to any one stock. That process of diversification limits their exposure. More important, since the stocks don’t all move together, their movements can offset each other and reduce the overall riskiness of the portfolio without sacrificing return. So diversification has the virtue of insulating against risk without giving up that much return; this is why diversification is so strongly recommended. In <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>, we’ll return to the idea of diversification to talk about how risk is priced.</p>
<p>Mutual funds are often classified as active—meaning a manager personally decides which stocks to hold in the portfolio—or passive. The growth of passive mutual funds (index funds and exchange traded funds) has been one of the most important developments in capital markets. Between 2011 and 2018, passive mutual funds grew from one-fifth to one-third of the total money managed by professional investors. In 2017 alone, $692 billion flowed into passive mutual funds.</p>
<p>Passive funds aren’t actively managed by someone who tries to time the market or select underperforming stocks that will eventually rise. Instead, passive funds simply invest in all the stocks in a broad market index such as the S&amp;P 500, which tracks five hundred of the world’s most valuable companies. Given their mechanical nature, passive funds are relatively cheap to invest in. But it’s not just that they’re cheap. Passive funds are a manifestation of a Nobel Prize–winning idea known as the “efficient market theory.” This theory suggests that if information is widely available to investors, then it’s impossible to outperform the market because prices already reflect that available information. So trying to beat or time the market over the long term is a useless endeavor. From this perspective, why pay <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_92" aria-label="92"></span>active managers lots of money to do something that isn’t possible?</p>
<p>There is considerable debate over the efficient market theory. However, the underlying logic that it’s difficult to beat the market on a sustainable basis, combined with the promise of increased gains from diversification, has proven true and has driven the rise of low-cost, passive investing at the expense of actively managed funds.</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Pension funds.</span> These funds are large pools of money that represent the retirement assets of workers from a particular company, union, or government entity. As one example, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) manages over $320 billion of pension assets on behalf of the public employees in California. Generally, pensions can take one of two forms. In defined benefit (DB) plans, employees receive payments after retirement from their employers, which are funded by pension plans run by those companies or organizations (such as CalPERS). In contrast, companies with defined contribution (DC) plans simply contribute to individual pension accounts that the employee manages. While many public employees have DB plans, pensions have shifted dramatically away from DB plans and toward DC plans during the last fifty years. This shift, in turn, has fueled massive growth in mutual funds.</h4>

<p class="RV"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The portfolio of Google, Caterpillar, and Merck is the most diversified of the three. The objective of diversification is to have a collection of stocks that do not move together and do not share the same risks. For example, when Google does poorly, Caterpillar might do well. The risk of having a portfolio concentrated in a single industry is that often industry stocks tend to move together, which is less likely if the companies are from different industries.</span></p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Foundations and endowment funds.</span> Not-for-profit foundations and organizations sometimes retain and invest funds over long periods to create more stability for their operations. These foundations and endowments, which have grown over the last several decades, are now large, innovative players in capital markets. For example, Harvard University controls a $37.1 billion endowment as of 2017.</h4>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_93" aria-label="93"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Sovereign wealth funds.</span> Countries with excess savings—typically stemming from natural resources—often invest those savings through a sovereign wealth fund. These funds have grown dramatically over the last several decades and have become more experimental in their investment strategies. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, for example, manages a sovereign wealth fund of over $1 trillion as of 2017.</h4>

<section epub:type="division">
<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Hedge funds.</span> The final institutional investor is the most controversial—hedge funds have grown from $260 billion in assets in 2000 to $3 trillion in 2017. Although they are similar to mutual funds, they are differentiated by their lower level of regulation and use of leverage and their different approach to managing risk.</h4>
<p>Hedge funds, which include many pension, endowment, and sovereign wealth funds as customers, have lower levels of regulation because only so-called sophisticated investors (which just translates to “rich”) can buy them. Accordingly, their managers are less constrained in their attitude toward risk. For example, a hedge fund may amplify its buying power by buying shares using borrowed funds. So instead of investing $10,000 of a client’s money, it will borrow additional amounts from a broker and then invest, for example, $20,000. Leverage will amplify the returns, as we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_1.xhtml">chapter 1</a>. Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds can also take more concentrated positions in companies, which allows them to become “activist” shareholders that promote the policies and strategies most beneficial to their investors.</p>
<p>Although hedge funds are willing to assume risk by taking significant stakes in individual companies with leverage, they attempt to manage this risk by, unsurprisingly, <i>hedging.</i> While hedge funds are demonized as being risky, they argue that they are <i>less</i> risky because of this risk management. Mutual funds manage risk by diversifying across stocks, but that still leaves them vulnerable to overall stock market movements. Hedge funds attempt to manage risk better.</p>
<p>How can a hedge fund that invests in Merck, a global pharmaceutical company, manage the risk of that investment? A mutual fund would limit its investment in Merck by buying many other stocks, but a hedge fund would rather focus its efforts on a company it really likes. A “hedge” (as in real life when you want to “hedge your bets”) is another investment that moves the opposite way that Merck does so that it provides a return when Merck falls. For these purposes, let’s consider another pharmaceutical company, Pfizer. A hedge fund will “go short” Pfizer to manage its exposure because it “went long” Merck.</p>
<p>What does all that mean? “Going long” is relatively simple—it just means you buy the stock. “Going short” is more complicated. To short a company’s stock, you borrow <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_94" aria-label="94"></span>shares from another investor, such as a mutual fund, which charges a fee for lending the shares to you. Once you’ve borrowed the shares, you sell them. At some point in the future, you buy back the shares (hopefully at a lower price) and return them to the institutional investor whom you borrowed the shares from.</p>
<p>Imagine you go short Pfizer at $40, and Pfizer then drops to $20. How have you done? You borrowed shares of Pfizer, sold them, and received $40; later, you bought shares at $20 and then returned the shares, leaving you with a gain of $20 per share. This means that you’ll make money when Pfizer declines. If Pfizer went up to $80 or $120, you would actually end up losing a fair amount—in fact, you could lose far more than you had initially committed. (See <a href="#fig3-3">figure 3-3</a>.)</p>
<p>How does all this relate to hedging? Let’s imagine that both Merck and Pfizer are selling at $100. You decide to go long Merck, but how can you manage that risk? You don’t want to buy other pharmaceutical companies or other types of companies as mutual funds do. Instead, you go short Pfizer for the same total dollar amount as your long position in Merck. How does your investment strategy perform?</p>
<p>Let’s look at real data from 2012 to 2014. (See <a href="#fig3-4">figure 3-4</a>.) During 2012, both Merck’s and Pfizer’s stock were moving together quite tightly. By December, they’d both gone up by 20 percent. If you sold your Merck shares and repurchased Pfizer shares at year end, thereby closing out your position, you would end up at the same place where you started. The gains on your long position (plus 20 percent because Merck went up) are offset by your losses on your short position (minus 20 percent because Pfizer went up too).</p>
<figure class="table">
<a id="fig3-3"></a>

</figure>
<p>Now let’s look at 2013. By the end of 2013, Pfizer had outperformed Merck. By December, Pfizer was up 50 percent and Merck was only up 40 percent. Because your Pfizer stock <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_95" aria-label="95"></span>went up by more than your Merck stock went up (your short outperformed your long), you lost money. Finally, let’s look at 2014. During that year, Merck outperformed Pfizer. By December, Pfizer had risen a total of 60 percent and Merck had risen a total of 70 percent. Because your long outperformed your short, you made money.</p>

</figure>
<p>So hedging can help insulate an investor from sectorwide or marketwide movements and isolate the relative performance of a given company. In that sense, you have managed risk because you are now exposed to only the relative outperformance (or underperformance) of a given company’s stock.</p>
<p>Hedge-fund managers also receive carried interest, a compensation model that allows them to participate in the economic returns of their funds. The combination of leverage and carried interest means that fund managers are particularly attracted to outsized returns and will go to great lengths to find investment opportunities. As one example, consider a fund manager looking to see if JCPenney will have a good holiday season. Rather than talking to analysts such as Moel or building the models we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, they may go to much greater lengths, such as taking satellite images of JCPenney’s parking lots on Black Friday to get an early sense of the store’s quarterly results or hiring former counterintelligence officials to verify the validity of its executive’s statements. And if a hedge fund is shorting a stock, it may be willing to publicly attack a company. These aggressive maneuvers attract supporters who appreciate the work hedge funds are doing and produce detractors who consider them vaguely evil for attacking companies.</p>
<p>Equity research analysts such as Moel pitch ideas to these varied institutional investors, but what do they get in return? Institutional investors don’t actually pay analysts directly for their ideas. Instead, institutional investors rank analysts based on the quality of their recommendations. These ratings are a critical component to the analysts’ compensation. Indeed, being the number one–ranked equity research analyst can yield compensation that is several times that of a number ten–ranked analyst.</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Jeremy Mindich, founder of Scopia Capital, a hedge fund in New York City, commented on the hedge fund business model:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Scopia’s basic investment philosophy is that we should be able to find great longs and great shorts at any moment in time so that the disparity of returns between those long positions and those short positions should be the source of our return stream. We’re not looking for short-term trades; we’re not looking to invest in companies because of their quarterly earnings.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">So we always had the idea that you can find, in any market environment, companies that are grossly mispriced, both undervalued and overvalued, to construct a long or short value portfolio. We call ourselves a market-neutral fund, which means that we have little or no net exposure to the stock market. Generally, market-neutral funds are quantitatively driven, so they tend to be collections of stocks driven by a quantitative algorithm that creates a basket of two hundred to three hundred undervalued long ideas (by whatever factor criteria) and another couple of hundred short ideas that are, for whatever reason, considered overvalued. The hope is that by leveraging that portfolio and squeezing out small differences in returns, you can create an interesting return stream.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">At Scopia, we’re trying to have a concentrated portfolio of roughly twenty to twenty-five long ideas and roughly thirty to forty short ideas. The long ideas are deeply researched, significantly mispriced, undervalued companies, and the short ideas are also deeply researched, significantly mispriced companies. The vision we have for the future of those businesses creates the investment opportunity.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_96" aria-label="96"></span>Taken together, these institutional investors make up “the buy side,” a collection of organizations that accumulate funds—often from individuals—and use them to buy assets in the financial markets. Who is the buy side buying from? Mutual fund managers don’t typically knock on the doors of companies and offer to buy their stock directly. For that, they reach out to someone on “the sell side.”</p>
</section>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Sell Side</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Equity analysts make significant amounts in compensation, but we haven’t yet identified any dollars being paid to anyone. So where’s the money? Analysts such as Moel typically work for investment banks that constitute the sell side. Within these banks, equity analysts speak to three constituencies—<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_97" aria-label="97"></span>traders, salespeople, and investment bankers—to provide ideas about the companies they cover.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Is Short Selling Evil?</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Shorting is a controversial activity and leads to many questions. Is it proper to benefit when companies do poorly? Or is that just evil? Should we ban that activity?</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Despite these concerns, short sellers do play a positive role in markets, as they often highlight what is going on in companies that are not doing well. For example, short sellers discovered the wrongdoing at the likes of Enron and WorldCom, both of which participated in the largest corporate governance scandals we’ve seen. Since short sellers are incentivized to look for flaws, weaknesses, and discrepancies, they see things that others don’t see. Given that, one could make the argument that short sellers are a force for positive social good, as opposed to something evil.</span></p>
</div>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Traders</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Traders, sometimes known as market makers or broker-dealers, ensure that there are buyers and sellers for various financial instruments. They make money largely from the gap known as the bid-ask spread. A bid is the highest price an investor is willing to pay for a share, while the ask is the lowest price that a seller is willing to sell a share for. Those on the buy side don’t pay analysts directly for their reports; rather, they can choose to trade through the broker-dealer associated with the equity analyst they like, who then makes commissions on those trades. This is one way the buy side can show appreciation for the equity analyst’s work. However, these commissions have narrowed significantly over time, so they’re a relatively small part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Even in the face of declining commissions, it is quite valuable for broker-dealers to process trades. If you’ve ever been on a trading floor, you know that traders deal in the short term, where the decisions of the large institutional investors is what matters. Traders find it quite valuable to know the trading activity of these investors because the transactions contain information. Are large funds buying? Are they liquidating? This is valuable information for traders, so good equity research analysts ensure that their traders get a share of trade flow.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_98" aria-label="98"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Salespeople</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unsurprisingly, salespeople sell financial instruments to investors on the buy side. Analysts might talk directly to the larger institutional investors, but salespeople disseminate the analyst’s ideas to the broader community to woo the buy side more directly. This can generate commissions and trade flow, but it isn’t where the big money really is.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Investment bankers</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the commercial bankers you interact with for loans and deposits, investment bankers work with companies that either want to raise capital or want to buy or sell operating assets. Financing arranged by investment banks, such as initial public offerings (IPOs), equity offerings, and debt offerings, allows companies to access new funding. The mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) departments of investment banks help companies divest portions of their businesses or acquire new businesses. In effect, investment banks are brokers for businesses. Both IPOs and M&amp;As are extremely lucrative. Fees for equity financings can be as high as 7 percent of the proceeds for an IPO. Similarly, advisory fees on M&amp;A can be close to 1 percent, so a $10 billion transaction can deliver $100 million in fees. These fees typically dwarf other trading revenue streams.</p>

<p class="noindent">Moel’s final set of conversations allow him to broadcast his ideas to an even larger audience. Equity research analysts use the media (e.g., the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, Squawk Box on CNBC, or Bloomberg TV) to disseminate their ideas to a broader audience, including households that invest directly. Often, analysts provide commentary on the latest developments and will use those occasions to communicate their more general views of a company.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Incentives for Equity Analysts</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">The conversations of equity research analysts such as Moel span the capital markets depicted in <a href="#fig3-2">figure 3-2</a>. They speak to companies that need capital, the buy side that pools the capital of the households, the sell side that intermediates the markets for stocks and companies, and the financial media. In effect, equity research analysts are at the center of the capital markets. Capital markets are important for capitalism, so it’s worth thinking through what incentives exist for the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_99" aria-label="99"></span>individuals who stand in the middle of these markets. And assessing their incentives is critical for figuring out what this high-priced talent in capital markets is getting paid for and whether they are really worth it.</p>
<p>As we saw, a critical component of analyst compensation is a ranking system deployed by the buy side to signal sentiments about which analysts provide the best advice. This ranking results in a tournament-like labor market where the best analysts do very well, while lower-ranked analysts don’t do as well—compensation drops sharply as they move down in the rankings. How does an analyst get a good ranking? If rankings are everything, then analysts should supply the buy side with the best analysis possible, presumably through hard work and creativity. In short, analysts should focus mostly on doing their job well. If this were the whole story, we could rest assured that capital markets were working well.</p>
<p>In fact, evidence shows that analysts can be biased, often strongly, toward being positive, meaning they rarely tend to issue “sell” recommendations and instead issue a disproportionate share of “buy” recommendations. Why?</p>
<p>Think about what happens when an analyst issues a negative report on a stock, which says that a company is overvalued. Ultimately the investors will appreciate the truth and rank the analyst highly. But, what else might happen along the way? First, the CEO and CFO of the company will not appreciate the lack of confidence and may try to shut out the analysts by not engaging with them or not taking their questions on the next conference call. If the CEO and CFO are really angry, they could call the analysts’ investment banker colleagues and signal that they won’t work with the investment bankers on future M&amp;A and financing deals. Given the relative magnitude of the revenue streams, this could be disastrous. As a result, analysts find it very hard to say “sell” and instead say things like “market perform” or “neutral,” which really means “sell.”</p>
<p>The rankings system itself creates additional problems. What would new, young research analysts at a less prestigious investment bank do? With nothing to lose, they often say crazy, extreme things; if they’re right, they shoot up in the rankings for being brave, and if they’re wrong, no one was paying attention anyway.</p>
<p>For higher-rated analysts, there’s a different pathology. If you’re the number one analyst, how do you make sure that the number two and number three analysts never overtake you? You “herd” alongside them. If you estimate earnings to be precisely in between the estimates of the number two and number three analysts, it’s unlikely that you can be unseated by those analysts. Of course, just herding and copying what <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_100" aria-label="100"></span>other people are doing is precisely what analysts should not be doing.</p>
<p>Thus, the incentives for the people at the center of the capital markets are considerably more complicated than you might hope. It would be wonderful if the only incentive for analysts was to work hard and do their job. Unfortunately, that’s not the case—they tend to be positively biased, and some “herd” by copying other analysts while others say extreme things.</p>
<p>Hopefully, now you can review the diagram shown in <a href="#fig3-2">figure 3-2</a> and really understand the complexities of capital markets. But these complexities still leave a central question unanswered: Why are all the people in the middle making so much money? Are they doing anything of value? Why can’t the people who have the capital—you and me, as households—get together with those needing the capital—companies—and get rid of everything in the middle? Why can’t the world of finance be simpler?</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Problem at the Heart of Capital Markets</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing the mess in <a href="#fig3-2">figure 3-2</a> might just intensify your skepticism about the value of capital markets. It can appear that all of finance just extracts value from the companies and savers who make up the “real” economy. So let’s explore whether capital markets are, in fact, solving a deep and difficult problem and what that problem might be. Why is bringing together savers and companies so complicated?</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Paul Clancy, CFO of Biogen, commented on capital markets:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The sell side, the buy side—there are lots of different places where all this gets distorted. We compete for investors. We compete for capital. What we are doing is providing retirement savings, savings that people want to pass on to the next generation, or savings that people want to invest and send their children. We compete for John and Ellie, their retirement account, and John and Ellie’s education account. They have alternatives.</span></p>
</div>
<p>What’s the deep problem that capital markets—and much of finance—solves? Let’s begin with a simpler question: Who has all the information about the future of companies that we as investors want to know? Clearly, the managers of the companies do. But can I trust the managers when they share that information? The problem is that we can’t necessarily trust what managers tell us. They want something from us—our capital—so they may tell us things that aren’t true in order to get it. The inability to credibly share information is called asymmetric information; it’s a deep and hard problem that all the people in the middle of <a href="#fig3-2">figure 3-2</a> are <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_101" aria-label="101"></span>trying to solve. While some CFOs—like Paul Clancy and Laurence Debroux—are good people, some will inevitably shade things to their advantage.</p>

<p class="FIGT"><span class="SANS_Helvetica_Neue_LT_Std_75_Bold_B_11">The problem of asymmetric information</span></p>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="../Images/Figure_03-05.svg"><img src="../Images/Figure_03-05.jpg" alt="" width="2139" height="1113"/></object>
</figure>
<p>In a world of perfect information, capital markets are relatively simple—they just need to pool resources and price risk (something we’ll turn to in <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>). But in a world of asymmetric information, capital markets need to figure out how to allocate capital when you don’t know whom to believe. The clouds in <a href="#fig3-5">figure 3-5</a> represents that problem.</p>
<p>The problem of capital markets is a manifestation of an even more general problem known as the principal-agent problem. Historically, many individuals worked for themselves <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_102" aria-label="102"></span>in trade or agriculture—they both owned and managed their businesses. In modern capitalism, the scale of enterprise has grown and owners are no longer managers; now owners (the principal) have to monitor managers (their agents) to ensure that they’re not misbehaving. The separation of ownership and control creates the problem of corporate governance: How do shareholders ensure that managers are pursuing their interests? Finance is all about trying to help solve that monitoring problem.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that the CEO of a company is contemplating a large acquisition. She shares her forecasts for the company to be acquired and advises the owners that the acquisition is a great idea. But, what if she just wants to run a larger company and her ability to lead a transformational acquisition could place her in a higher echelon among CEOs? She could get a better job with more pay. So is the acquisition great for the company or for the CEO? What about plans for a new headquarters? Is the move to attract talent, as the CEO says, or just managers padding their compensation with an on-site five-star gym facility and a better breakfast buffet than you can get at the Four Seasons?</p>
<p>This problem pervades all of a company’s interactions with financial markets. The CEO misses an earnings forecast by a penny and attributes it to bad weather conditions. Is it true or does the mistake signal the beginning of the end for the company? Suspicion by investors about the company helps explain the large price drops associated with small earnings misses because those misses may be for more than one quarter. It’s about credibility and asymmetric information. When a CEO announces that she is divesting part of her shareholding in a so-called normal portfolio rebalancing plan, it could be true. But the reality is that someone who knows much more than you do about the future of the company is selling shares. That can be alarming.</p>
<p>Managers and owners engage in a complex communication game where every signal coming from a manager is reevaluated with suspicion in the background. For companies, the problem of asymmetric information can also affect whether they finance their projects through equity, debt, or internally generated profits. Each method signals a different message to investors. For example, an investor may balk at a company using equity. If the project is so great, why issue new shares? The questions become: Why are the owners, if they’re so confident about the future, willing to share the upside? Why wouldn’t they keep the upside for themselves by issuing debt? This is the reason equity issuance is usually associated with stock price declines. It’s not because of dilution or an accounting argument. It’s because the stock issue sends a negative signal. To some investors, the company looks as if it is unwilling to finance the project internally and, therefore, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_103" aria-label="103"></span>the project isn’t as great as it seems. Equity becomes the most expensive source of financing.</p>
<p>Debt seems a little better. Although a company is still relying on external capital providers, at least it’s not giving up ownership. But, whenever a company goes to outside sources for funding, investors will always ask why. The best source of financing is internally generated funds. There’s no informational cost associated with it, but it can be a limited source.</p>
<p>One last thing to consider is stock buybacks, an increasingly important phenomena we’ll return to in <a href="../Text/chapter_6.xhtml">chapter 6</a>. When a CEO announces a stock buyback, she’s implicitly telling investors that she thinks the stock is undervalued. That’s why share buybacks are often greeted as good news, again, not because fewer shares are outstanding. Instead, stock buybacks can send a powerful signal of confidence from the managers who know more than the investors.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">The Persistence of the Principal-Agent Problem</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">If finance is meant to ameliorate the principal-agent problem, how is it doing? Given the repeated crises in corporate governance, it’s easy to conclude that the financial markets aren’t doing their job well, so their promise is unfulfilled. But first, it’s important to consider how we could intervene to improve corporate governance. If you were in charge of the world, how would you try to solve this problem?</p>
<p>Here are a few possibilities. First, could we punish managers more when they lie? This is tempting, but it can lead them to say less and less, thereby increasing the level of asymmetric information. Second, we could pay managers with more equity so they behave like owners want them to. Equity compensation has become much more common in the last several decades but comes with its own issues. Managers may orient their performance to short-term results and then sell shares at their peak level. Could we create a board of directors above the managers to monitor them and represent owners? Well, who’s going to pick those directors? Often, it’s the managers themselves. And to complicate matters, they may serve on the board of the CEO who sits on their board. Every potential solution leads to collateral consequences that can amplify, rather than ameliorate, the problem.</p>
<p>Finally, private equity can help by effectively replacing dispersed owners with one large owner who carefully monitors, and uses leverage to constrain, management. But private equity also creates its own issues—these investors realize profits by issuing stock to capital markets and have incentives to make their companies appear better than they are prior to going public.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_104" aria-label="104"></span>Hopefully, this will help you make sense of other things happening in capital markets. Hedge funds often take activist positions and try to influence managers to make significant changes. They are often maligned as irksome troublemakers. But maybe they’re correcting against some of the biases in the markets that give managers too much power. Maybe short-sellers, who are also maligned, aren’t evil but are actually heroes for fighting the tide of excess optimism that managers and analysts often create. Finally, it shows you that the capital markets are not a perfect solution to this problem but finding a way to make progress against this problem is not straightforward at all. The separation of ownership and control demanded by the scale of modern enterprise means that the principal-agent problem is here to stay—and that is in part what makes finance so fascinating.</p>

<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Used-Car Markets</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The problem of asymmetric information and the phenomenon of signaling are not concerns for capital markets alone. We see these concepts in our everyday lives.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Think about the used-car market. Let’s say you go to the Volkswagen dealer and buy a new car for $50,000. After a few days, you decide that you don’t want the car. If you put it on the market, how much will you get? The answer is likely not nearly the depreciated value, which would be close to $49,999. It will be closer to $45,000 or $40,000. Why is that? Because potential buyers will be skeptical and think there’s something wrong with the car that you’re not revealing. After all, the person with all the information about the car—you—is selling. In order to deal with their skepticism, you’ll need to cut the price to a point where buyers would be more willing to take on the risk.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Things can get worse. Imagine that some people really do have good cars, but just need to sell because they’re moving across the country. And imagine that some people actually got lemons when they bought the cars and now are trying to sell to somebody who’s unsuspecting. What happens when the buyer reduces his price to $45,000 or $40,000? The answer is that people with good cars say, “I don’t want to be in this market anymore,” and they leave. The average quality of the used cars goes down. The buyers reduce their price even further. More good cars leave the market, and the market unravels. That’s why asymmetric information is so destructive.</span></p>
</div>
<p>If, as a CEO or CFO, you know about these problems with capital markets, how would it affect the way you run your company and the way you communicate with the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_105" aria-label="105"></span>capital markets? CEOs and CFOs need to manage their credibility with capital markets because the loss of investors’ faith can be particularly problematic. As such, overpromising is particularly dangerous. At the same time, underpromising and overdelivering can cause investors to expect surprise performance—an expectation that you won’t be able to live up to.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head-new"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_13120">IDEAS IN ACTION</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">The pursuit of three investment ideas demonstrates some of the concepts from our exploration of capital markets. We’ll return to the aftermath of the Sharp Sakai plant investment, consider a short investment in a wire manufacturer, and examine a leveraged buyout (LBO) by Morgan Stanley Private Equity.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Hon Hai Sharp and the Sakai Plant</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">In the case study in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, I introduced Sharp’s Sakai plant, a factory designed to make large glass displays for televisions. Sharp’s large investment in the new factory was unwise and proved untenable, and Hon Hai chairman Terry Gou personally purchased a stake in it. There are some more interesting wrinkles to this story, which will exemplify the principal-agent problem.</p>
<p class="TXB">Gou’s investment in the Sakai plant was one of two moves jointly announced in March 2012. The other was that Gou’s company, Hon Hai, which assembles glass displays for the likes of Apple and Microsoft, would buy more than US$800 million in equity from Sharp, which would make it Sharp’s largest investor.</p>
<p class="TXB">When equity analyst Alberto Moel heard the news from one of his clients, he was puzzled. He’d followed Hon Hai throughout his career. The company had a reputation as being opaque, and the dual transaction in this case was puzzling. Why would Hon Hai buy a large stake in Sharp while its chairman used his own personal wealth to buy a 46 percent stake in the Sakai plant.</p>
<p class="TXB">If both transactions were completed, Hon Hai would own Sharp, and at the same time, Sharp would sell an asset to Gou, Hon Hai’s chairman. As we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, the sale to Gou appeared to be happening at a fire-sale price, creating a great amount of value for Gou. But where did that value come from? In effect, Gou was taking value from Sharp shareholders—but that included Hon Hai, the company he ran! Market commentators speculated that Hon Hai’s promised investment in Sharp was just designed to facilitate the sale of the Sakai plant to Gou at a rock-bottom price.</p>
<p class="TXB"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_106" aria-label="106"></span>After the deals were announced, Sharp’s stock price dropped and kept dropping because the company had received so little for the plant from Gou. Hon Hai attempted to renegotiate for a lower price, but when that failed, Hon Hai withdrew its offer. The chairman, however, kept his side of the deal and bought a large stake in the Sakai plant.</p>
<p class="TXB">What do you think about Terry Gou’s actions? Your answer depends on your views of the Sakai plant. If you agree with the argument that the plant had significant value, then the chairman was effectively preparing to take value from Hon Hai’s shareholders. As a major shareholder in Sharp, Hon Hai was giving its chairman an underpriced asset, removing a Sharp asset worth $3.2 billion for only $1.7 billion, an incredible deal. In other words, why not let Hon Hai shareholders participate in the great deal that the Sakai plant turned out to be? That’s the uncharitable view. On the other hand, if you think that the plant was very risky, then the chairman was committing his own money to shield his company from additional risk.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Short Selling Bekaert</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">In 2010, Jeremy Mindich’s hedge fund, Scopia Capital, decided to short-sell Bekaert, a company that makes steel wire. After gaining significant expertise in steel wires, Scopia thought that Bekaert was overearning relative to its historic margins because it manufactured wires that went into radial tires used in industrial machinery. Most companies at the time were focused on electrical wires for the housing market, which left Bekaert as one of the only companies focused on the industrial market. As a result, it was earning outsized returns that were likely unsustainable. Mindich believed that Bekaert’s earnings would revert to the mean as its competitors looked toward the industrial market.</p>
<p>Scopia further examined the numbers and saw that earnings had been steadily climbing from 2006 to 2008, and then dropped because of the global financial crisis. The question was, would growth resume? The consensus from analysts was yes. The next step was trying to find competitors and gauge how they were doing. Scopia discovered that a number of Chinese competitors were looking to enter Bekaert’s most profitable customer segment.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What would you want to know about the Chinese competitors in order to determine if Bekaert will be able to maintain its high margins?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1">Two members of Scopia’s team visited the Chinese wire companies and tried to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul class="iqbl">
<li class="iqabl">What were their expectations for the new wire plants?</li>
<li class="iqabl_last">What were their expected margins?</li>
</ul>
<p class="iqa_next"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_107" aria-label="107"></span>After talking with representatives from the companies, the analysts at Scopia decided that their expectations for future profits were much lower than the market’s.</p>
<p>From this information, Scopia was able to deduce that Bekaert shareholders were in for a nasty surprise, although it wasn’t sure when. While people were arguing about whether the industry’s growth was going to continue or stall, Scopia saw something much worse: earnings were going to be cut in half. “In the case of Bekaert, we saw this industry returning to sort of normal margins,” recalled Mindich. “An industry that had been enjoying outsized returns was heading toward a more normal environment.” So Scopia decided to short the stock.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Assuming you want to short Bekaert, what are the risks of doing so?</b></p>
<p class="TNI1"><a href="#fig3-6">Figure 3-6</a> shows the price of Bekaert’s stock from 2006 to 2013. The price rise through late 2010 reflected the unsustainable optimism that Mindich was hoping to capitalize on. Although Scopia’s predictions turned out to be right, it ended up shorting the stock too early and had to endure a year’s worth of losses while Bekaert’s stock price rose about 30 percent. Mindich said, “That’s not the goal. We’re not hoping to find ideas that are going to cause us so much pain before they work out. But because we had done so much work and we were so convinced about the ultimate fundamental case for the business, we were able to wait out the storm because we were sure that it was not sustainable.”</p>

</figure>
<p class="iqa_next">You can imagine how painful it was for Scopia to watch its investment thesis go wrong for the first year as Bekaert stock rose and stayed high. With short sales, there is unlimited potential loss because the stock price can continue to rise, possibly catching investors in a “short squeeze,” where short sellers are forced to buy their share back while the stock price continues to rise. Mindich’s analysis and determination allowed Scopia to see the investment thesis through to its conclusion.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_108" aria-label="108"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The Leveraged Buyout of Tops Friendly Markets</span></h1>
<p class="TNI1">In 2007, Morgan Stanley Private Equity purchased Tops Friendly Markets, a supermarket chain in upstate New York, in a leveraged buyout (LBO). Private equity firms purchase companies using debt, improve operations, and then sell the company to the public markets or to a strategic buyer. The leverage can substantially increase their returns.</p>
<p class="TXB">Morgan Stanley jumped at the opportunity to buy Tops for a few reasons. First, Royal Ahold, a Dutch grocer that owned Tops, was a distressed seller with a firm objective: it wanted its US asset off its balance sheet by the end of 2007, which meant that its move was more about timing than about trying to sell at full value. In this type of situation, managers may be somewhat irrational in their desire to sell an asset quickly.</p>
<p class="TXB">Since Royal Ahold was in a rush, the current management team at Tops was likely to stay on with the parent company, which would allow Morgan Stanley to hire its own CEO. The team hired Frank Curci, who had led Tops five years before Royal Ahold took over. Curci’s knowledge and expertise, the team surmised, would be invaluable in helping the team return the company’s operations to their previous condition.</p>
<p class="TXB">According to Morgan Stanley’s Alan Jones, one of Tops’ most attractive characteristics was that it was a “classic corporate orphan.” Since Royal Ahold’s headquarters were geographically distant from the Tops stores, it had trouble managing the business, a common problem. So even though the operating margins and the return on capital were much lower than that of other comparable companies in the supermarket business, Morgan Stanley thought that, with better management, the business could thrive again. The next step was to look at the financials and highlight areas for improvement. The team took a three-pronged approach: change its pricing strategy, improve its technology, and reconnect with its customers.</p>
<p class="TXB">At the time, Tops was trying to compete against two very different competitors: Walmart, a low-end, big-box chain, and Wegmans, a regional, high-end grocery chain. Competing with Walmart on pricing was an impossible feat. So early on, the team decided to position Tops between the two. This would mean adopting a more traditional, high-low supermarket model, which entails pricing common items such as bread at a competitive price and then pricing other merchandise at a higher one. The team thought this pricing model would be a key to Tops’s success.</p>
<p class="TXB">Curci noticed right away that Tops seemed to have lost its connection to its customers. For example, many Tops <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_109" aria-label="109"></span>stores are located in the Buffalo area of western New York, the birthplace of buffalo wings (deep-fried chicken wings). Curci noticed that the wings were conspicuously absent from the stores. He thought this pointed to a much larger oversight of a basic retailing rule: give the customers what they want. It also reinforced the need for a better technology system. The old system meant that the previous management team was unable to respond to customer needs and inventory changes. With an assist from new point-of-sale technology, Tops began to cater more to the local customers, many on tight budgets. It replaced all the gourmet food with more basic staples. With this in mind, Curci left the merchandising decisions to the managers at individual stores, after Morgan Stanley put them all through an extensive capital expenditure program. This step was crucial in positioning Tops between Walmart and Wegmans because it allowed managers to respond more quickly to local demands and fluctuations.</p>
<p class="TXB">In order to fulfill its plan for selling Tops, the team calculated that it would have to increase its leverage by taking on more debt, which would have raised the debt of Tops to 96 percent of assets. This much leverage was unusual and potentially risky for Morgan Stanley. But after much analysis, working closely with the management team, and hiring a consultant to gauge whether the company could thrive at that debt level, Morgan Stanley decided to proceed. One thing that made the decision easier was that, due to quick inventory turnover, supermarkets are very capable of generating cash flows.</p>
<p class="TXB">After increasing its leverage, 30 million shares remained. Since the top managers had done so well in turning the company around, Morgan Stanley gave them the opportunity to buy in. In the end, Morgan Stanley made about 3.1 times its original investment, the management team at Tops was able to independently operate its stores, and Tops thrived through the transaction.</p>

<p class="noindent">I hope this whirlwind tour of the capital markets has demystified the complex world of institutional investors, analysts, and investment bankers for you. Many people see the world of finance that sits between savers and companies as a group of leeches subtracting value from the real economy. But capital markets are trying to solve, albeit imperfectly, the deep problem of capitalism—the principal-agent problem that arises when owners are no longer managers, and asymmetric information makes monitoring and communication difficult. As a result, it becomes clear that finance isn’t really about money and cash. Ultimately, it’s all about information and incentives.</p>
<p>With asymmetric information and principal-agent problems at the forefront of your mind, you can make more sense of Netflix’s sharp stock price drop because of a small subscriber shortfall. Any unexpected departure from expectations can prove very costly because that departure can magnify investors’ concerns about managers. And you can see that the battle between Nelson Peltz and PepsiCo’s management is an effort by an activist shareholder to make sure that management is pursuing what’s in the best interest of shareholders. However, Peltz has his own agenda that may not align perfectly with other shareholders, creating yet another incentive problem.</p>
<p>Now that we have examined the informational problem at the heart of capital markets, we can turn to an even bigger question: What is a company worth? We will next address how firms create value, how they are valued, and how they should make investment decisions based on their cost of capital.</p>
