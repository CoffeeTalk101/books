</hgroup>
<p class="noindent"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_151" aria-label="151"></span>Whether you’re buying stock, acquiring a company, buying a house, or investing in education, you need to go through a process of valuation. Is the proposed investment justified? How much should you pay? These are all fundamentally questions of valuation, and finance has a rigorous set of tools for thinking about how to make those decisions. Consider the following examples:</p>
<p>In late 2012, Facebook reportedly made a $3 billion offer to purchase Snapchat. By 2016, Google had reportedly valued Snapchat at $30 billion. By mid-2018, the equity markets were valuing Snap at $17 billion. What were these wildly different numbers based on?</p>
<p>In mid-2018, Disney and Comcast were locked in a battle to acquire 21st Century Fox, with escalating prices. How did they know what to offer? Why were their bids so much higher than the valuation embedded in the stock price?</p>
<p>Is investing in an education worth it? Should I buy a home or rent? My buddy made a killing in Bitcoin; should I invest as well?</p>
<p>In previous chapters, we discussed how value is created and the relationship between risk and return. We also talked about the importance of cash. In this chapter, we’ll bring those two pieces together to build a method for valuation.</p>
<p>While the methods are rigorous, it’s critical to remember that valuation is an art, not a science. More accurately, it’s <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_152" aria-label="152"></span>an art <i>informed</i> by science. Valuation is subjective, prone to error, and leads to ambiguous answers. While you might find that unsatisfying, there simply is no other way to make these important decisions wisely. Although ambiguous, the process of valuation is as important as the end point. Only by evaluating different scenarios, probabilities, and models can you fully understand a business. So even if it’s flawed and problematic, valuation is critical to sound managerial decision making.</p>
<p>In the first half of the chapter, we’ll focus more on the science and clarify the underlying methods. In the second half, we’ll turn to the art—the most subjective elements and the areas where the most games are played.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Two Alternative Valuation Methods</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">Given the imprecision of valuation, it’s useful to rely on alternative methods to ensure an accurate outcome. There is no magical way to figure out value; there are just multiple methods that help you triangulate around reality. The two most important valuation methods are multiples and discounted cash flows. Let’s start with multiples. Though you may not realize it, you’ve probably used them in your own life. Once you understand their weaknesses, we’ll move on to the gold standard—discounted cash flows.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Multiples</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">A multiple is a ratio that compares the value of an asset to an operating metric associated with that asset. Beyond that fundamental structure, there is no other rule for creating multiples, and therefore there are numerous variants. A common multiple used in valuations is the price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratio, which divides a company’s stock price by its earnings per share. Alternatively, it’s the value of a company’s equity divided by its net profit. That ratio, for example, might be 15 times, or “15X.” This means that you’re willing to pay $15 for every dollar of earnings that a company generates. This quick, back-of-a-napkin calculation is easily communicated and provides an easy method to compare companies.</p>
<p>A P/E multiple of 15X might seem puzzling. Why would you be willing to pay $15 for $1 of earnings? In short, that 15X, like everything in finance, reflects expectations of the future. So you’re not just paying for $1 of earnings; you’re paying for a stream of future earnings that is expected to grow. Does this imply that all multiples should be the same within an industry? Because firms may grow earnings at very different rates and because companies might be judged to have earnings that vary in quality, the P/E ratio can vary across companies within an industry. Differences in P/E ratios <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_153" aria-label="153"></span>should occasion a question: Why would $1 of a company’s earnings be worth so much more than another? Is it that much better operationally or is it overvalued?</p>
<p>As we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, earnings are a problematic measure, and we can use other measures of cash—earnings before interest, taxes, debt, and amortization (EBITDA); operating cash flow; or free cash flow—to construct multiples as well. As we saw in <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>, there is another important capital provider—a lender who provides debt—so the multiples should reflect the fact that companies can use that type of capital as well. These two lessons are reflected in the use of enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA multiples (EV/EBITDA), where EV is the sum of the market value of debt and equity, or the value of the business. The EV/EBITDA multiple helps us compare companies of varying capital structures.</p>
<p>How can you use multiples? <a href="#tab5-1">Table 5-1</a> shows three major companies in the cosmetics industry and their enterprise value/EBITDA multiples at year-end 2016.</p>
<p>Using this information, how would you value Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G), a fourth company in the same industry, that generated an EBITDA of $17.4 billion for fiscal year 2016. Using the average of the multiples above—12.5—you would multiply P&amp;G’s EBITDA by 12.5 to arrive at an estimate of its enterprise value, which would be $217.67 billion.</p>

<p>What do you make of this exercise? It raises the following questions: (1) Is P&amp;G only a cosmetics company? (2) Do all these companies serve the same geographic markets and the same customer segments? (3) Do these companies distribute their products in the same way? The enterprise value of P&amp;G at year-end 2016 was $242.1 billion. In other words, P&amp;G trades at a 13.9X EV/EBITDA multiple.</p>
<p>Like much of finance, using multiples is a method that initially seems odd but is something that you may already understand. You may have used a multiple in the most important financial decision you’ve ever made—buying a home. Specifically, most of us figure out if a home is a good investment by looking at “price per square foot (or meter),” which is nothing more than a multiple. You derive prices per square foot by dividing house prices by total square footage—a measure of value divided by an operating metric. It can be a useful way to talk about transactions in your neighborhood <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_155" aria-label="155"></span>(e.g., “Honey, did you see that the house down the street sold for $600 per square foot—we’re rich!”), and whether or not you should pay so much for a home (e.g., “The house down the street sold for only $300 per square foot—why should we pay $400?”). These sentiments are no more or less sophisticated than an experienced private equity investor saying, “We bought that company at an EBITDA multiple of 8X.”</p>

<p class="BH1"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_154" aria-label="154"></span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Twitter versus Facebook</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Multiples are a pliable method and can use any operating metric. Consider Twitter’s initial public offering (IPO). How would you value Twitter at the time it went public? It didn’t have profits or EBITDA or, for that matter, much revenue. But surely it was worth something. At the time, market participants emphasized its valuable user base and looked for companies with comparable revenue models within social media. They turned to Facebook and calculated how much every user of Facebook was worth and used that multiple to value Twitter.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">For example, each Facebook user was worth slightly more than $98 (taking its total stock market capitalization divided by its number of active users [$117 billion divided by 1.19 billion active users]); LinkedIn users were worth about $93 each ($24 billion divided by 259 million active users). A few hours after its IPO launched, Twitter was trading at a valuation that indicated the market valued each of its 232 million active users around $110. The graph shows Twitter’s and Facebook’s relative stock performance from November 2013 to late 2018.</span></p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The pros and cons of multiples</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">This discussion of multiples highlights their many strengths. They are simple to calculate and communicate. Multiples also can be powerful because they are based on current market prices, and that means <i>someone</i> actually valued a company and put their money where their mouth is—it’s not some imaginary value conjured by a spreadsheet. Finally, its ease of use makes comparisons between companies (and houses) seemingly quick and straightforward. The key word there is “seemingly.”</p>
<p>Although multiples provide quick, easy ways to compare companies, they have many flaws. The attributes that make multiples popular—the ease of comparability, their market-based logic—are also what led people into trouble. First, and foremost, comparability is not always so straightforward. Think back to the house example. Price per square foot ignores many factors. Does one home have a better view, while the other looks at a parking lot? Does one have shag carpeting, while the other has original hardwood floors from the 1800s? There are many factors that make a square foot in one home not the same as a square foot in another.</p>
<p>But surely a dollar of earnings is simply a dollar of earnings? Let’s say you were looking to invest in eBay and began your valuation process by comparing it to Apple. For the year ending December 31, 2015, eBay generated earnings per share (EPS) of $1.60. On that same date, Apple’s share price was 12.7 times its EPS. Using Apple’s 12.7 <span class="symbol">×</span> P/E ratio to value eBay would value eBay’s stock at $20.32.</p>
<p>eBay finished trading on that day at $27.48—$7 more than expected. This simple comparison—and discrepancy—would lead you to believe that eBay is either overvalued or doing something truly exceptional, or Apple is undervalued.</p>
<p>But does it make sense to compare Apple with eBay? Probably not. Apple sells products and eBay is an online marketplace that connects sellers to buyers. Is it Amazon? Is it Facebook? Not really. It’s hard to come up with a company that is really comparable with eBay’s business and revenue models. Yet using a multiple may trick you into thinking that there is.<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_156" aria-label="156"></span></p>

But how did the chain compare to others in the industry? By using a multiple—in this case, dividing a chain’s valuation by the number of stores it operates (a key operating metric in retail)—you can more accurately compare Shake Shack to other well-established chains, which have more stores (see the bar graph).</span></p>

<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Shake Shack’s per-store valuation was much higher than its competitors.

The line graph shows the subsequent stock price performance.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_157" aria-label="157"></span>Even when a within-industry comparison is more straightforward, it’s not clear a dollar is a dollar for undertaking multiples analysis. The earnings stream in one company may grow substantially faster than another, making the implicit assumptions of a multiples analysis faulty. And because many decisions associated with calculating earnings might differ across companies, they can be incomparable for multiples purposes. Investors sometimes talk about the “quality” of earnings, implying that some companies have more sustainable earnings than others. By taking a multiple from one company and slapping it on the other, you’re assuming the growth trajectories and quality of earnings are fundamentally similar, and that could be a mistake.</p>
<p>Although market-based logic can be a virtue, it can also be a vice. Just because your neighbor paid an exorbitant $500 per square foot, that’s no reason for you to make that same mistake. That is precisely what happened in the real estate bubble. If the “masses are asses,” you’re going to have a serious problem. As a consequence, we need a better way to think about valuation.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Problematic Methods for Assessing Value</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at two more problematic methods of valuation before exploring the gold standard method.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Payback periods</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first method assesses projects based on the amount of time it would take for investors to get their money back—the payback period. You simply compare the initial outflow of funds with subsequent inflows and ask: In what year do I get my money back? That’s a very appealing way to think about whether an investment is attractive or not. Inherently, it feels good to get paid back quickly.</p>
<p>To see this method and its problems in action, choose between two projects, each of which requires a $900,000 investment. You can choose only one and use payback period as your criterion. <a href="#tab5-2">Table 5-2</a> shows the projected cash flows for each project.</p>
<p>Which project would you choose? Project A has a payback period of less than two years, and project B has a payback period of three years. If payback period is your decision-making criterion, you should choose project A.<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_158" aria-label="158"></span></p>

<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_159" aria-label="159"></span>As this example illustrates, the payback period method has some significant problems. By comparing these flows over time in this way, the time value of money is ignored. The second—and even worse—problem is that the answer to a payback period analysis is a simple number of years. But that’s actually not what we’re interested in; we’re interested in creating value. The payback method could lead you to choose an investment because you get your money back faster, but turn away from an investment that creates much more value.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The table shows the average price per square foot for housing in twenty-five cities worldwide. As you can see, there is tremendous variation—from $77.20 per square foot in Cairo to $2,654.22 per square foot in Hong Kong. What accounts for this disparity? In some cases, prices reflect demand—prices are correlated with average income levels. But cities such as Hong Kong, London, and New York effectively enjoy worldwide demand because they are global commercial centers. Supply can play an important role as well—Hong Kong is a small area that can only accommodate so many units of real estate. Alternatively, local government policies can reduce the amount of building allowed and thus available housing (one reason that San Francisco is so expensive).</span></p>

<p>Using a discount rate of 10 percent, project A has a net present value of $193,160, and project B has a net present value of $354,700. By using payback period, you selected the project with a considerably lower net present value, which leads to much less value creation. That comparison reflects why payback analysis is so problematic.</p>

<h3 class="head c-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Internal rates of return</span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Using internal rates of return (IRR) to assess projects is another very common valuation method. This method is not as problematic as payback analysis, partially because it is closely linked to discounted cash flows. But it still has problems. When we introduced the idea of discounting, we used forecasted cash flows and a discount rate to find a present value.</p>
<p>IRR flips that analysis. IRR analysis takes forecasted future cash flows and finds the discount rate that makes the present value zero. Here is the formula for calculating an IRR:</p>
<figure class="EQ-IMG"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg159.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>In other words, IRR analysis captures the rate of return that will be experienced if the forecast is realized for a project. What could possibly be wrong with that? Why not analyze investments by just looking at their IRR? The idea of a rate of return is very powerful and accounts for IRRs’ pervasiveness. Once you have an IRR, you can compare it to the weighted average cost of capital or discount rate. That’s a little bit like the value creation exercise from <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>While this is an appealing way to think about the world, IRRs are problematic for two reasons. First, IRRs can give you the wrong answer because they’re focused on returns and not value creation. You can compare two projects, and the higher IRR project might actually lead to less value <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_160" aria-label="160"></span>creation. Again, you’re interested in value creation, not in rate of return maximization.</p>
<p>Second, if cash flows are characterized by outflows, and then inflows and outflows again, and then inflows (as opposed to a simpler version using just outflows and then inflows), IRRs can give you wrong answers. Moreover, IRRs incur these risks and don’t actually save any effort. Calculated IRRs must be compared to a weighted average cost of capital using forecasted cash flows. So we need the same information as we did to do the discounting in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the earlier example to see the first problem. (See <a href="#tab5-2">table 5-2</a>.) The net present value (NPV) of project A was $193,160, and the NPV of project B was $354,700. Now that you understand IRR, you can calculate the two IRRs. The IRR of project A is 22.9 percent, and the IRR of project B is 22.9 percent. Ignoring NPV and focusing on IRR would have made you indifferent to the two projects. There is a clearly dominant project choice that IRR analysis obscures. This difficulty occurs, in part, because, as managers, we are not interested in increasing returns; instead, we should prioritize creating value.</p>

<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Discounted Cash Flows</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The discounted cash flow method is the gold standard of valuation. Fortunately, it does nothing more than combine the key lessons from <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapters 2</a>, <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">3</a>, and <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">4</a>. From <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, we know that assets derive their value from their ability to generate future cash flows, and those cash flows aren’t all created equal—they require discounting to translate them to today’s numbers. From <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>, we know that the appropriate discount rate is a function of an investor’s expected returns as they translate into a manager’s cost of capital. Finally, from <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>, we know that ascertaining the information to do this valuation will be a tricky process.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by providing a slightly modified version of the basic present value formula from <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>:</p>
<figure class="EQ-IMG"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg160.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>There’s one new term (i.e., the terminal value) at the end of the formula—we’ll return to that soon. But the basic logic is still the same. All value today is derived from the expectation of future cash flows. We need to figure out how to forecast those cash flows and to decide which definition of cash and what discount rate to use.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="BH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Buying a Home Using Discounted Cash Flow Analysis</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One way to appreciate the importance of discounted cash flow analysis relative to multiples is to revisit housing decisions. Rather than using multiples when buying a home, how could you use discounted cash flow analysis?</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">With multiples, your analysis is limited to looking at your neighbors and deriving the average price per square foot that they paid. To do a discounted cash flow analysis, ask instead: What are the cash flows from owning a home? Some flows are obvious. On an ongoing basis, you might have to invest in a new roof. That would be the capital expenditures from your free cash flow analysis. Similarly, there may be some tax effects. But the primary cash flow associated with buying a home is the cash flow that you</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">don’t</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">spend on rent. Any project’s cash flows are the incremental cash flows generated by that project, and buying a house means you don’t have cash outflows of rent. So the value of a house is primarily associated with the rent payments you don’t have to make once you buy a home.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">This way to think about buying real estate can help you avoid overpaying. The key metric that revealed that a housing bubble had been created in the mid-2000s was the rental yield ratio—a comparison of renting versus buying. If you do a discounted cash flow analysis, you may find that it really doesn’t make sense to buy and instead you should be renting. Multiples obscure a lot of hidden assumptions about what’s going on when you use them. Discounted cash flow analysis makes things explicit. In this particular case, the analysis makes explicit the trade-off between renting and owning, which is precisely what was ignored during the housing bubble.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Free cash flows, as you might remember, are flows that assets generate that are truly free and truly cash. They are available to capital providers after accounting for costs and expenses. Free cash flows can be deployed for new investments, or they can be distributed to capital providers.</p>
<p>Just to recall the basic formula: (1) start with projected EBIT, or earnings before interest and taxes, that is generated by the operating assets, (2) subtract taxes to get EBIAT, or earnings before interest and after taxes, (3) add back noncash expenses like depreciation and amortization because they should never have been taken out, and (4) accommodate the capital intensity of the business by <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_162" aria-label="162"></span>penalizing it for investments in its working capital and fixed assets.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Step 1: Forecast future cash flows.</span> Imagine that your company is considering investing in a new laboratory.</h4>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BLT">The lab will require an initial capital expenditure of $2.5 million in year 0.</li>
<li class="BL">The expected EBIT in year 1—the first year of operations—will be $1 million.</li>
<li class="BL">This EBIT of $1 million is expected to increase by 5 percent every year thereafter. At the end of year 5, operations will end and the assets will be sold for their salvage value of $1 million.</li>
<li class="BL">During the life of the project, the assets will be depreciated and ongoing capital expenditures will be made to maintain the assets. The net effects will be a $300,000 depreciation expense and $300,000 in capital expenditures for years 1 to 5 to maintain the equipment.</li>
<li class="BL">Working capital is required for the project and is assumed to equal 10 percent of EBIT. In other words, in year 1, when EBIT goes from $0 to $1 million, the company will need to invest $100,000 in working capital. In year 2, when EBIT goes from $1 million to $1.05 million, the company will need to invest $5,000 more in working capital. For simplicity, let’s assume that all working capital associated with the project expires worthless at the end of the five years.</li>
<li class="BLL">The company’s tax rate is 30 percent and there are no tax consequences to selling the asset in year 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating your own spreadsheet with this information is a great exercise. The spreadsheet in <a href="#tab5-3">table 5-3</a> provides the free cash flows for this project. You can try to match it. To build such a spreadsheet, I always find it useful to begin with a section at the top that lists the relevant assumptions. Once I have gathered my assumptions, I begin filling out the spreadsheet by taking the initial EBIT, growing the EBIT at the prescribed growth rate, and adjusting for tax payments, which gets me to the EBIAT. Then I can follow the formula for free cash flows.</p>
<p>There are a few tricky steps here. First, following the timing of the project is critical. Second, the working capital calculation is not the <i>level</i> of working capital but rather the <i>change</i> in the level of working capital. Third, I’ve lumped together capital expenditures with the asset disposal in the final year, which creates a positive cash flow in that year. And, finally, it’s important to settle on a system of keeping track of what the inflows and outflows are. In this spread<span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_163" aria-label="163"></span>sheet, all outflows are negative. Then the totals for the free cash flows are just sums of the figures.</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Step 2: Apply the WACC.</span> The free cash flows this business generates are free to the capital providers, so their expected returns translate into the cost of capital used to discount future cash flows—via the weighted average cost of capital (WAAC). To briefly summarize, the WAAC calculates the costs of both debt and equity, weighs these costs by their relative importance in the financing of the investment, and includes a tax effect that captures the deductibility of interest. The capital asset pricing model helps us understand where costs of equity come from, and betas capture the measure of risk by considering the perspective of a diversified investor.</h4>
<p>To figure out the relevant WACC for the investment in this lab, consider these facts:</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BLT">The optimal capital structure for such investments is 35 percent debt and 65 percent equity.</li>
<li class="BL">The risk-free rate is 4 percent.</li>
<li class="BL">The lender will charge 7 percent interest on the new project.</li>
<li class="BLL">The market risk premium is 6 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Now you have everything needed to generate a cost of equity and figure out the WACC—except the beta. To do that, plot the monthly returns for companies that capture the risk of <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_164" aria-label="164"></span>the project, plot them against the market return, and then plot the regression line (see <a href="#fig5-1">figure 5-1</a>).</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Although multiples have their flaws, they can often double-check discounted cash flow assumptions, so many companies use them as part of a multipronged valuation effort. Alan Jones, global head of private equity at Morgan Stanley, commented:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">The multiple of EBITDA is meant to be a quick, short-term proxy, because it is linked to a cash flow measure. Heuristic measures have evolved in which people talk about valuations in terms of multiples of EBITDA. We also tend to look a lot at multiples of free cash flow because we want to know what our capital expenditures are and what our investments in working capital are, but that’s a very frequent multiple for us to look at as well.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">So when we’re looking at the valuation of the business, we’re typically triangulating a number of different metrics. We do a discounted cash flow analysis first and foremost; that’s really the anchor of a valuation approach. It’s particularly important because we can determine what changes we can make to the business that will affect the discounted cash flow. But we also look at where comparable companies trade in the public market; that’s typically a multiple of, again, EBITDA or net profit in the business. We look at EBITDA multiples and then comparable acquisition multiples, where have people recently purchased companies, and what they are paying for businesses like ours.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">When we’re looking at a valuation opportunity, we ask: What is the discounted cash flow analysis telling us, what are comparably traded companies telling us, and what are comparable acquisition multiples telling us? Then we gauge which is most important in the business we’re looking at. Is one an outlier for a particular reason? We apply some real thoughtfulness to triangulating among those three measures of value. But at the end of the day, it’s all about generating cash and our ability to purchase what’s ultimately a stream of cash flows over time.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The slope of the line in the figure is 1.1; therefore, the beta is 1.1. Now, use the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then the WACC using the formulas from <a href="../Text/chapter_4.xhtml">chapter 4</a>. (See <a href="#tab5-4">table 5-4</a>.)</p>
<p>The final step is to return to the forecasted free cash flows and determine net present values. Discount factors are simply <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_165" aria-label="165"></span>1 divided by 1 plus the WACC. Finally, multiply all of the free cash flows by the discount factors and sum them to determine the net present value. (See <a href="#tab5-5">table 5-5</a>.)</p>
<p>The net present value of this investment is $1.069 million. Because the NPV is positive, the lab project will create value for the company, and you should go forward with it. Alternatively, if you were to measure the present value of the cash flows, it would be $3.569 million.</p>

In these situations, it’s typical to settle on a year when you expect the company’s growth to stabilize and then summarize the value in all future cash flows through a simple set of calculations. This is called a “terminal value”; it summarizes the value of the investment at the end of the forecasted cash flows.</h4>

<p>There are two ways to get terminal values. The first is via multiples. When you’ve reached an end point, say, five years into an investment, you could say that the company has reached a valuation of, for example, ten times free cash flow.</p>
<p>The other, and preferred, way to think about terminal values is to deploy a “perpetuity formula”—a neat trick that effectively calculates today’s value for a stable set of cash flows. If you want to get the present value of a stream of <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_166" aria-label="166"></span>cash flows that doesn’t grow over time, you can just divide that cash flow by the discount rate.</p>

<p>Of course, many perpetuities, including companies, continue to grow. In particular, if somebody promises you a growing perpetuity—for example, $100 every year forever that grows at 3 percent—that also collapses into a very convenient formula. The present value of that growing perpetuity is nothing more than the initial cash flow divided by the discount rate less the growth rate. It almost seems like magic.</p>

<p>When you use this as part of a discounted cash flow analysis, the present values these formulas provide are the present value as of the year before the initial cash flow. For example, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_167" aria-label="167"></span>if the numerator of the equation is the cash flow in year 6, the formula will produce the present value in year 5. That means you will need to discount this value again in order to get the present value today.</p>
<p>If these formulas are so convenient, why don’t we just use them rather than the spreadsheet mechanics discussed? In short, there are many short-run dynamics that can be very important to model explicitly—new factories, sales trajectories, cost reductions, and so on—and those dynamics can have a large impact on value. You can only use these formulas when things settle into a steady state.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a danger in this step of the valuation process, especially in the assumption of the growth rate. For example, if the company is in an economy that’s growing at 3 percent and uses a terminal growth rate of 7 percent, that’s an untenable assumption. It means that ultimately the company will take over the world, which we don’t really believe will happen. As a consequence, in the long run, overall economic growth rates are a useful way to think about what growth rates should be in a terminal value calculation.</p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Step 4: Compare enterprise values versus market values.</span> Now that you have the value of a given enterprise (the lab project), you can just divide that figure by the number of shares and compare it to the existing stock price, right? Not quite. Through the valuation, you have determined the <i>value</i> of the business, not its equity. The value of the business is often called enterprise value. If you think back to the diagram of free cash flows seen in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, you have valued the cash flows to the capital providers—both debt and equity—that the enterprise generates.</h4>
<p>Sometimes, enterprise values will be much more than the market value of equity. For example, if the enterprise value is $100, and the company holds $40 of debt, the equity value is only $60. This can go the other way, especially if the company holds a great deal of cash, in which case, the company’s market value can be greater than its enterprise value.</p>
<p>If you take a look at Apple in 2013 or 2014, you’ll see that its market value was $500 billion, but it held more than $100 billion in excess cash that it didn’t require for its operations. As a consequence, the actual implicit value of the enterprise was lower than the market value. The important lesson here is that to get to the value of a company’s equity from the enterprise value, you need to think about how much debt and cash there is.</p>
<p><a href="#fig5-2">Figure 5-2</a> shows Apple’s enterprise value and cash versus the market value of its debt and equity from 2012 to 2016. In the figure, market values are used along with cash and debt levels to arrive at <i>implied</i> enterprise values. When conducting a valuation of Apple’s business, you should compare the <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_168" aria-label="168"></span>valuation to the implied enterprise value rather than to the market value because those values can differ by more than 30 percent.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One opportunity the growing perpetuity formula provides is that it allows us to work backward from existing valuations to determine the underlying assumptions.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Let’s look at three major retailers and see what the market thinks about their implied discount rates and growth rates. The three retailers are Walmart (a discount retail chain), Costco (a wholesale bulk consumer retailer), and Amazon (an online retailer). We’ll compare their enterprise value (EV), a measure of the total market value of their debt and equity, to their EBITDA using the data in the table.</span></p>
<p class="BSH1"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Assuming that all three companies are growing at steady rates, what do these multiples imply for how the market feels about the implied discount rates and growth rates for these companies?</span></p>
<p class="BTNIS"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Look more closely at Walmart. We can use some algebra to convert the enterprise-value-to-EBITDA multiple into a growing perpetuity formula. In short, a 10 X multiple must correspond to a ten percentage point difference between discount rates and growth rates. For example, it might indicate a discount rate (</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">r</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">) of 15 percent and a growth rate (</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">g</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">) of 5 percent (</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">r</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">−</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">g</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">= 10 percent). A 7.97 X multiple might represent a growing perpetuity formula in which the denominator (</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">r</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">−</span> <span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_Oblique_I_11">g</span><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">) equals 1/7.97, or 12.5 percent. That might represent a discount rate of 18 percent and a growth rate of 5.5 percent, or it might represent a discount rate of 15 percent and a growth rate of 2.5 percent.</span></p>

The market may believe that Amazon has a higher growth rate than Costco, which has a higher growth rate than Walmart. Alternatively, it may believe that Amazon is a less risky business and has a lower discount rate than Costco, which has a lower discount rate than Walmart. Or it could be a combination of the two. Given the similarity of the companies, it’s likely that the discount rates are the same and that all the variation reflects differential expected growth rates.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One key difference to be aware of in this example, and generally, is that mapping multiples to discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis works best when the multiples are of free cash flow (FCF) rather than earnings or EBITDA. In short, value corresponds to discounted FCFs, so using EBITDAs is imprecise. In particular, if there are large future capital expenditures, future EBITDAs might be considerably higher than future FCFs.</span></p>

<h4 class="head d-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Step 5: Analyze scenarios, expected values, and bidding strategies.</span> Once you’ve created the machinery and arrived at a value for one scenario, you might think you’re done. In reality, this is where the fun begins. To really understand the investment and to arrive at a value of the asset, you have to think through the “expected value” of the asset. You just valued the asset under a certain set of assumptions. What if you’re wrong? In some sense, you’re sure to be wrong—the likelihood of the world lining up with your assumptions precisely is close to zero.</h4>
<p>The appropriate way to arrive at the correct expected value is to consider alternative scenarios such as a worst-case scenario, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_169" aria-label="169"></span>a best-case scenario, and a base case and attach probabilities to them. Creating these scenarios and attaching probabilities to them is one of the most important steps for an analyst—it forces you to really think through the nature of the business and its potential outcomes. For example, if there’s a 10 percent chance that the value is $120 (best case), a 70 percent chance the value is $100 (base case), and a 20 percent chance of a $10 value (worst-case or fraud scenario), what is the expected value? $120, $100, or $10? In fact, it’s none of those. The expected value must be calculated by probability-weighting scenarios.</p>
<p>The expected value formula is fairly simple:</p>
<figure class="EQ-IMG"><img width="400" src="../Images/pg169.jpg" alt=""/></figure>
<p>So, in this case, the expected value is $84.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_170" aria-label="170"></span>Once you get the expected present value and know it’s associated with an enterprise value, how would this inform your bidding strategy if you’re buying a company? Let’s say you come up with the underlying expected value of $84. Is that your opening bid? Or is it the most you’re willing to pay? Are you willing to go as high as the best-case scenario of $120? Maybe the maximum bid should be the value associated with the worst-case scenario?</p>
<figure class="table">

</figure>
<p>The expected value should be the final offer. If you pay that price, your investment will have a net present value of 0. There’s nothing wrong with that, per se, but you haven’t actually created any value for yourself. It should be your final and ultimate bid. Your opening bid should be something considerably lower. If you end up paying $75 for that asset, you’ve actually created $9 in value and unless you pay less than the expected value, your purchase is not actually creating any value in expectation. And if you pay up to the best-case scenario of $120, for example, in the first two scenarios, you have transferred value to the seller and created no value in the best case. In expectation, you are destroying value for your capital providers.</p>

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">Valuation is everywhere, including the most important investment of all: how you should invest in yourself. Is paying for an education worth the money? In a September 2016 memorandum on higher education that the US Council of Economic Advisers produced for the Obama administration, it was determined that workers with bachelor’s degrees earn nearly $1 million more over the course of their careers than similar workers with only a high school diploma. Individuals with an associate’s degree earn $330,000 more than those with only high school diplomas.</span></p>
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">As we know, pure cash flow values cannot just be added up. Instead, we need to discount them and then find the present value. The present value of these cash flows is $510,000 for bachelor’s degrees and $160,000 for associate’s degrees. If prospective students took this valuation, subtracted the cost of education, and applied the NPV rule (invest whenever NPV is positive), they would pursue a bachelor’s degree whenever the costs of that degree were less than $510,000. Given that this calculation will often be positive, does it mean that every college education will be worthwhile in terms of incremental wages?

<p class="noindent">Now let’s turn to the mistakes that are often made when doing a valuation. This is an art and not a science, so there are a variety of judgment calls involved. After the announcement of an acquisition, it’s fairly common for the stock of the acquirer to fall, indicating that it likely overpaid and transferred value from itself to the target.</p>
<p>That begs the question: Why are firms systematically overpaying? The answer is that they must be doing something wrong during the valuation process. Here, I highlight three major mistakes and consider more in the next chapter.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Ignoring Incentives</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The first, and most pervasive, mistake is that it is easy to ignore the incentives of the people involved in an acquisition. Certainly, sellers of assets want acquirers to overpay. And sellers control important sources of information, including historic financial information. This problem is reminiscent of the asymmetric information problem from <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>. What do you think the seller has been doing as it prepares for a sale? The seller might make itself look particularly good by accelerating sales, deferring costs, and underinvesting. This circumstance makes due diligence a critical part of any acquisition process.</p>
<p><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_172" aria-label="172"></span>The problem doesn’t stop with the seller. Typically, investment bankers get paid only on completion, so they want you to make the deal. Even people within your company who have analyzed the transaction have perverse incentives. They may well anticipate getting a promotion to run the new division just acquired. Everyone involved in the transaction wants the transaction to happen and may subtly change assumptions or forecasts to help make that outcome a reality. As a result, this sea of unbalanced information leads to overpayment and overconfidence.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Exaggerating Synergies and Ignoring Integration Costs</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Synergy is the idea that once merged, the value of two companies will be greater than the sum of the values of each individual company. On the surface, the idea of synergies isn’t unreasonable. For example, if you bring two sales forces together and rationalize them, this should result in cost savings. If you bring two companies together, you could control more capacity within an industry and gain more pricing power.</p>
<p>Imagine if Amazon wanted to merge with eBay. The ability to use both sets of customer lists or both sets of vendors in the combined entity might be powerful. Alternatively, there might be a number of back-office and computing expenses that could be reduced by combining the two companies. Both cases are examples of synergy. The combined company could access customers the companies couldn’t have otherwise or it could cut costs in a way that it wouldn’t be able to separately.</p>
<p>The problem with synergies is that people tend to overestimate how quickly those synergies will work and overestimate the magnitude of their effects. They ignore the fact that mergers are complicated and that changing cultures and changing workforces takes time. The second, related problem is that, even if the synergies are legitimate, people will often incorporate all those synergies into the price they pay for a company. That too can lead to overpayment since the rewards from the value creation of synergies are transferred to the acquired company’s shareholders instead of being part of the value creation the merger brings to the acquiring company.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_95_Black_B_11">Underestimating Capital Intensity</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">One final error that eager bidders make is to understate the capital intensity of the business. Ongoing growth in EBIT or free cash flows typically requires increasing the asset base through capital expenditures. But those capital expenditures reduce free cash flows dollar-for-dollar—and are conveniently ignored by people anxious to do deals. For example, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_173" aria-label="173"></span>terminal values will assume perpetual growth rates but in the final year you are modeling (which serves as the basis of the terminal value), capital expenditures will just equal depreciation, indicating no growth in assets. In effect, understating capital intensity inflates values.</p>
<div class="gre">
<p class="BH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_15">Real-World Perspectives</span></p>
<p class="BSH"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_85_Heavy_B_11">Alan Jones, global head of private equity at Morgan Stanley, commented that he often tries to consider the ratio of the terminal values to total values to better understand a transaction:</span></p>
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_45_Book_11">One of the chief problems with discounted cash flow analysis is that so much of it depends on the terminal value, the value for which you ultimately sell the business; we focus very heavily on that. So whenever we generate a discounted cash flow analysis, we literally print out what percent of the overall valuation is as a result of the sale of the business because then we’re not really thinking about the cash flow generation in the business—we’re really making a bet on where we’ll be able to sell that business ultimately.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Recall the example of Netflix from <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>. The key question for Netflix is how content acquisition costs will grow over time to sustain its growth. If you assumed tremendous growth in Netflix’s subscribers, you would also want to carefully project the capital intensity of the underlying business. Similarly, the valuation of a company such as Tesla hinges not just on customer growth—it must build factories to satisfy that demand—so understating capital intensity can lead to incorrect valuations.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Investing in Spirit Aero Systems</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">In 2012, Scopia Capital invested in Spirit AeroSystems, an airplane parts manufacturer, which it thought the market was mispricing. Boeing formerly owned Spirit and made up an outsized portion—over 80 percent—of its business. Rather than exclusively focus on Boeing’s 737, Spirit began working on airplanes for Airbus and Gulfstream, as well as a new project from Boeing—building a new fuel-efficient 787 called the Dreamliner.</p>
<p>A lot of excitement surrounded Spirit, but as it moved further along in the investment cycles for the Airbus and Gulfstream platforms, its earnings per share dropped from $2 to below $1. One problem was that Spirit’s operating assumptions about the profitability of these investments had been incorrect, and because its projects have extremely long <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_174" aria-label="174"></span>time horizons (ten to twenty years), it had to account for those charges up front, which hit its income statement. The stock, as a consequence, dropped.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Investors were valuing Spirit based on its price-to-earnings multiple, and its earnings had dropped significantly. What are the problems with using a P/E multiple–based valuation that may be relevant here?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two major problems with using a price-to-earnings multiple to value Spirit. First, earnings, as represented by net profit, are a problematic measure of economic performance, as discussed in <a href="../Text/chapter_2.xhtml">chapter 2</a>. Second, Spirit’s earnings were temporarily diminished due to up-front investments and the unique nature of its accounting system—a price-to-earnings multiple assumes that these temporary fluctuations will continue forever.</p>
<p>Scopia was in a prime position to evaluate Spirit because Spirit was a leader in a niche business—creating airplane fuselages and wing assemblies—that Scopia understood. Because of this familiarity, Scopia was able to take a deeper look at Spirit’s business and determine if the problems that the market was detecting were truly warning signs. For example, as Spirit built its 787 business with Boeing, the company’s cash flows took a dive because Boeing was still in the design stage and therefore had delayed the manufacturing process. In the meantime, Spirit was sitting on a huge inventory of parts. For investors, these circumstances were troubling. In most cases, this scenario would have been a great shorting opportunity.</p>
<p>On closer inspection, Scopia didn’t see these developments as problems at all. Although Spirit’s cash flows were negative, this was only temporary. Once its projects went into production, things would turn around. And those one-time charges to its balance sheet would disappear. Its contracts with Boeing, Airbus, and Gulfstream were long-term contracts that covered the life of the platform; in other words, as long as those companies were working on those platforms, Spirit would be the builder.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>What are some of the risks associated with stockpiling inventory for a future project? Think about discounting and the time value of money, as well as the nature of risk.</b></p>
<p class="noindent">There are two main issues here. First, Spirit is paying now for uncertain future cash flows that it may or may not realize. Second, Spirit is betting that its stockpiled inventories will not become obsolete and worthless. The first concern is a generic one for all investments, while the second concern is particularly acute for inventory.</p>
<hr class="transition_sb"/>
<p class="SB1">Scopia’s investment in Spirit wasn’t all smooth sailing. It was confident that Spirit’s price per earnings could rise to $3.50 <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_175" aria-label="175"></span>a share and its stock price could rise above $40. But early on in Scopia’s investment, Spirit had to take on another big charge, and the stock, which had hovered in the twenties, dropped to the midteens. At that point, Scopia had to decide if it should add more stock or exit the investment. Some investors see stock dips as opportunities to buy more stock. The market is ill-informed, the thinking goes, so why not double down at a cheaper price?</p>
<p>The team at Scopia took a step back, looked at its initial valuations, and examined the new situation. Ultimately, Scopia decided to invest more in Spirit—those charges, again, were one-offs. Once the drags on its business went away, and when its airplane projects went into production, Spirit began to follow the trajectory that Scopia had anticipated. <a href="#fig5-3">Figure 5-3</a> provides Spirit’s stock price movements from 2010 to 2017.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">Lessons from Dell</span></h1>
<p class="noindent">On September 13, 2013, one of the most iconic technology companies, Dell Computer, was taken private through a buyout undertaken by current management. The founder and CEO of Dell, Michael Dell, was working with the private equity firm Silver Lake to purchase Dell.</p>
<p>Since the February 2013 announcement of the proposed transaction, shareholders had been fighting the buyout. Accusations were levied against Michael Dell for his role in the process, and ultimately the case went to court for resolution. Walking through the conditions that led to the management buyout, the bidding process, and the subsequent court case that attempted to determine an accurate valuation for Dell can reinforce a number of lessons we’ve seen throughout the last few chapters.</p>
<p>In 1983, Michael Dell founded Dell in his freshman dorm room at the University of Texas. By 2012, it had grown into a global technology company that was selling PCs, servers, and storage devices. More recently, Dell had become convinced that to transform the company, he would have to branch out into software and services, as many of his competitors had done. Many analysts disagreed with the approach, <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_176" aria-label="176"></span>and revenues were flat and earnings were declining. In many ways, Dell felt that the market just didn’t understand what he was trying to do. During the first half of 2012, the stock decreased from $18 to $12, while the market was up nearly 25 percent. Feeling quite misunderstood, Dell began to explore the possibility of taking the company private via a management buyout. By taking it private, he would be able to rebuild the company, transform it into his vision, and do so without the scrutiny of public capital markets.</p>
<p>Given that Michael Dell was one of the potential buyers, the board formed a committee to review the management buyout proposal. Various valuations were done for the board and for different buyers, including private equity firms Silver Lake and KKR. By the time the bids were evaluated, the market had driven the stock price down to nearly $9.35, and in late 2012, Dell reported that revenue was down 11 percent and earnings were down 28 percent. (See <a href="#fig5-4">figure 5-4</a>.)</p>
<p>To consider the buyout, Dell’s board needed two things—a sense of the value of the cost-saving measures Michael Dell was proposing, and an idea of how private equity firms would value the company—to set prices at which the board would consider bids.</p>

<p>Dell management had identified $3.3 billion in potential cost savings. At the request of the Dell board, on January 3, 2013, Silver Lake had brought in the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to help with the valuation; it created three scenarios for the potential cost savings:</p>
<ul class="BL">
<li class="BLT">A base case, where no savings were realized</li>
<li class="BL">The BCG 25 percent case, where 25 percent of the savings were realized</li>
<li class="BLL">The BCG 75 percent case, where 75 percent of the savings were realized</li>
</ul>
<p>BCG believed that the 25 percent case was attainable, but doubted that the 75 percent case was very likely, as it would require Dell to achieve margins higher than it or any of its <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_177" aria-label="177"></span>competitors had ever achieved. That provided the Dell board with a sense of the cash flows. Next, it needed an idea of how private equity firms would value Dell.</p>
<p>The assumption was that Dell would be held private for 4.5 years before a public offering returned the shares to the public. Using the scenarios to determine the amount of cost savings, along with other forecasted assumptions, a future price of the stock in 4.5 years was determined: $32.49, $35.24, and $40.65, depending on the cost-saving scenario.</p>
<p>With these scenarios and future prices in hand, JP Morgan, on behalf of the Dell board, attempted to work out a price that an acquirer would pay for the company. For private equity, it is not unusual to work backward—determine the future price you expect to sell the company for, determine the rate of return you would like to earn, and then discount the price at that rate of return to determine the price you would pay today. <a href="#tab5-6">Table 5-6</a> summarizes the stock prices an acquirer would pay to achieve a 20 percent, 25 percent, or 30 percent return, assuming specific scenarios and future stock prices.</p>

<p class="STNIS"><b>How is this method similar to or different from the discounted cash flow method?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">In this situation, the investor is determining the required rate of return—not as a function of the asset’s risk, but just as a function of what it would like to earn—and determining a current value it would pay to achieve it, by discounting the future expected cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis attempts to find an appropriate discount rate and determine the current value of an asset. In contrast, the method described determines the return desired in a vacuum and the price that would yield that return. It may look very similar to a DCF analysis; it still takes the cash flows and discounts them back to find a value, but this method does not seek to arrive at an assessment of value. It seeks to find a price at which a return will be achieved.</p>

<p>On January 15, 2013, Silver Lake and Michael Dell offered to buy out the company for $12.90 per share. Three days later, the Dell board of directors rejected the offer and decided to set a minimum sale price before agreeing to any deal.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_178" aria-label="178"></span><b>What do you think is a good minimum price for the board to set, and why? Remember that Dell’s board wants to entice investors to bid on its company but also not give away too much value. Consider also the likelihood of the various scenarios occurring (make up percentages you think are reasonable). There’s no right or wrong answer, since any answer will be based on your own assumptions and beliefs.</b></p>
<p class="noindent">Based on these projections, the Dell board decided on a minimum price of $13.60 per share before beginning the bidding process. This minimum price was distributed to all potential bidders.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The Winner’s Curse</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The board invited bids. Ultimately, Dell and Silver Lake submitted the winning bid, and the company was sold for nearly $14 a share. While the winning bid was 40 percent higher than the low stock price of $9.35, many shareholders were suspicious of the transaction. They thought that the value was actually quite a bit higher. They were particularly worried that the nature of this transaction compromised the bidding process and emphasized two problems. First, in many ways, Michael Dell was functioning as a seller on behalf of the company and its shareholders, and as a buyer in tandem with Silver Lake, the private equity firm. Because he was both a buyer and seller, the shareholders argued there was an inherent conflict of interest for Dell. More importantly, because Michael Dell was a potential buyer and had all the information as the CEO of Dell, that created an informational problem. Dell had the most information about the company and knew the best value. Upon completion of the auction, anyone who had bid higher than Dell and won the auction would feel quite regretful, given that the person with the most information had a lower bid. That’s a version of the winner’s curse that can help undercut a competitive process.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The Process</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at how the deal actually played out. First, on February 3, 2013, Michael Dell and Silver Lake proposed a purchase price of $13.65 per share. Shareholders were immediately upset. On March 5, Carl Icahn and Icahn Enterprises proposed that Dell should instead perform a leveraged recapitalization worth $22.81 per share (through a $9 dividend and a $13.81 purchase price; for more on leveraged recapitalizations, see <a href="../Text/chapter_6.xhtml">chapter 6</a>). On March 22, the investment firm Blackstone floated a transaction at $14.25 per share, but decided against pursuing it without “a more level playing <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_179" aria-label="179"></span>field.” On June 19, Icahn submitted a proposal to the Dell shareholders to elect an alternative slate of board members who would stop the merger.</p>
<p>In response, on July 31, Michael Dell and Silver Lake raised their offer to $13.96 per share and proposed a modified voting process, in which fewer shareholders would need to approve the deal. The board approved these conditions on August 2, and at a special meeting on September 12, 2013, shareholders holding 57 percent of Dell’s shares voted in favor of the merger.</p>
<p>Many shareholders, nevertheless, remained upset. Some investors disagreed with Dell’s explanations for the recent poor performance of Dell’s stock, claiming instead that he had driven down the stock price of the company in order to decrease the price he would have to pay to take control of the company. Sometimes management might manipulate operations or accounting values to make the company look better (see <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a>); in this case, the shareholders claimed Dell had used his power as a manager to make Dell look worse to gain a bargain price for himself during the buyout.</p>
<p>Dell’s largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, characterized its concerns by saying the current deal “falls significantly short,” adding that it “appears to be an effort to acquire Dell at a substantial discount to intrinsic value at the expense of public shareholders.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_1" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Take a look again at Dell’s performance from 2011 to 2012 (see <a href="#fig5-4">figure 5-4</a>). Dell’s price had suffered after poor results throughout 2012, but it dipped further following a change in guidance released on August 16. That day, Dell reported that its revenue growth estimates had been revised down from 5 to 9 percent to from 1 to 5 percent. Michael Dell was the CEO of Dell at this point and had decided on August 14 that he wanted to take the company private.</p>
<p>The stockholders further disagreed with the way they felt the board had handled the buyout. In a particularly frustrated moment, Icahn characterized the Dell board in this fashion: “We jokingly ask, ‘What’s the difference between Dell and a dictatorship?’ The answer: Most functioning dictatorships only need to postpone the vote once to win <span class="ellipsis">…</span> The Dell board, like so many boards in this country, reminds me of Clark Gable’s last words in <i>Gone with the Wind</i>—they simply ‘don’t give a damn.’ ”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_2" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the shareholders objected to the manner in which the bidding process had been conducted; since Dell had full knowledge of the company’s internal forecast, who would bid against his stated valuation? In the ensuing legal case, the judge characterized the problem of the winner’s curse in this way: “You don’t bid on the contents of someone else’s wallet when they know how much money is in it.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_3" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p class="STNIS"><span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_180" aria-label="180"></span><b>With all these concerns, it might seem impossible to conduct a fair bidding process. If you were Michael Dell, what might you have done to create a level playing field?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">While full transparency with all documents seems like a good solution, it likely wouldn’t have left Michael Dell in a good negotiating position to place a competitive bid. Perhaps the best solution would have been to recuse himself entirely from the process, both as a bidder and as the CEO of Dell. As it was, the information concerns were impossible to ignore. Wall Street analyst Leon Cooperman characterized the deal as “a giant case of insider trading by management against shareholders.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_4" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-4">4</a></sup> The result of these concerns was litigation. The shareholders asked the court for an appraisal to see if the value of $14 a share was fair.</p>
<p>In these types of litigations, both sides commonly employ expert witnesses who try to value the company and help the judge figure out the correct value. The two experts here came to quite different numbers that reinforced their sides’ perspective. In particular, the expert for Silver Lake and Dell came up with a value of the company of less than $13 a share, suggesting that the $14 price was more than fair. In contrast, the expert for the shareholders who had felt cheated by the process valued the company at twice the value of the $14 bid, nearly $29.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, the two experts had valuations ranging from $13 to $29—a difference of nearly $28 billion! How could two experts come up with such different valuations? The valuation processes that the two experts undertook formed part of the record in this trial and provide a great opportunity to reinforce a number of lessons about valuation.</p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Why and how did the experts come up with very different valuations?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">First and perhaps most important, they used BCG’s scenario analysis in very different ways. The expert for the shareholders used scenarios that included quite optimistic situations for those underlying cost savings, while the expert for Dell and Silver Lake used relatively pessimistic assumptions about what would happen with those cost savings.</p>
<p>In addition to this difference in scenario analysis, they used a variety of other, different inputs to their models. In particular, the two experts used different growth rates of 1 percent and 2 percent for their terminal values. In addition, the expert for the shareholders used a tax rate of 21 percent, while the expert for Dell and Silver Lake used an 18 percent tax rate but then raised it to 36 percent for the terminal period. They disagreed on the right capital structure for the company, on the correct beta for the company, and interestingly, on the appropriate market risk premium. The expert <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_181" aria-label="181"></span>for the shareholders used a smaller market risk premium of 5.5 percent, while the one for Silver Lake and Dell used an market risk premium of almost a point higher at 6.4 percent. Finally, the two experts differed on the amount of cash that the business actually needed and how much net cash was in the business.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the court decided that the fair value of Dell was not the $14 per share that had been agreed on at the time of the sale, but $18 a share. The court concluded that the company was sold 25 percent cheaper than it should have been. The conclusion to the case resulted in Dell and Silver Lake paying the additional $4 to the shareholders.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h2 class="head b-head"><span class="SANS_Avenir_LT_Std_65_Medium_11">The Future</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This decision was controversial. Shareholder advocates cheered it, but others wondered about the precedent this decision created. The <i>New York Times</i> expressed concern that it could “lead to a spate of lawsuits and second-guessing over the price of the next big merger.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_5" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, the judge explicitly stated in the case that he believed Michael Dell and Dell management had acted ethically; yet, the price was not fair. The judge said, “It bears emphasizing that unlike other situations that this court has confronted, there is no evidence that Mr. Dell or his management team sought to create the valuation disconnect. To the contrary they tried to convince the market that the Company was worth more,” yet “the foregoing evidence, along with other evidence in the record, establishes the existence of a significant valuation gap between the market price of the Company’s common stock and the intrinsic value of the Company.”<sup role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref"><a id="chapter5_6" href="../Text/notes.xhtml#chapter5-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="STNIS"><b>Finally, what does this case suggest about valuation in general? Once you’ve completed a valuation, what should you do with it?</b></p>
<p class="noindent">This story reflects a number of lessons from <a href="../Text/chapter_3.xhtml">chapter 3</a> on the importance of incentives and information that are clearly present in the Dell management buyout. First, Michael Dell’s incentives as both a seller and a buyer were not exactly clear; that conflict of interest is the foundation of this case. Second, the company, the seller, was also the buyer in the form of Michael Dell. That’s what led to the winner’s curse setting where nobody wanted to bid higher than Michael Dell and Silver Lake.</p>
<p>The example also highlights a number of lessons about valuation. First, it points out the importance of scenario analysis and thinking about expected cash flows. Second, it shows how all the different assumptions in a valuation matter when figuring out current value. Finally, and perhaps <span role="doc-pagebreak" id="pg_182" aria-label="182"></span>most importantly, the story reflects the idea that valuation is an art and not a science. Two well-respected experts came up with extremely different values based on different assumptions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Valuation is central to finance and management. Some methods discussed, like multiples, are simply shortcut methods. Others, like IRR, can be useful but can go wrong. Fortunately, there is a gold standard—discounted cash flow analysis—that provides a way to understand the value of a business as the present value of all future cash flows.</p>
<p>The exercise of forecasting, though, returns us to one of the most important lessons of this chapter—valuation is an art informed by science. There is some science involved, but fundamentally valuation is subjective and laden with judgment. We have to make sure that we don’t make mistakes systematically, like overestimating synergies or underestimating the capital intensity of a business. The final lesson about valuation is that if you really want to understand a business, do a valuation of it. Only by thinking about the future, the cash flows, the capital intensity of a business, and the risk of the business can you truly understand that business.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed value as a function of free cash flows and discount rates, there is one final question to tackle. What should companies do with all those free cash flows? How should they give it back to capital providers? Or should they invest in new things? How should they allocate all those free cash flows across the businesses and capital providers? Those questions are the subjects of the next chapter.</p>
