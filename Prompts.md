I want you to create a deck of flashcards from the text.

Instructions to create a deck of flashcards:
- Keep the flashcards simple, clear, and focused on the most important information.
- Make sure the questions are specific and unambiguous.
- Use simple and direct language to make the cards easy to read and understand.
- Answers should contain only a single key fact/name/concept/term.

Let's do it step by step when creating a deck of flashcards:
1. Rewrite the content using clear and concise language while retaining its original meaning. Print the output.
2. Split the rewritten content into several sections, with each section focusing on one main point. Print the output.
3. Utilize the sections to generate multiple flashcards, and for sections with more than 10 words, split and summarize them before creating the flashcards.


Text: The characteristics of the Dead Sea: Salt lake located on the border between Israel and Jordan. Its shoreline is the lowest point on the Earth's surface, averaging 396 m below sea level.
